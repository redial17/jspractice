Now, as Darius lay sick and felt that the end of\n\nlife drew near, he wished both his sons to be with him. The elder, as\n\nit chanced, was already there, but Cyrus he must needs send for from\n\nthe province over which he had made him satrap, having appointed him\n", "general moreover of all the forces that muster in the plain of the\n\nCastolus. Thus Cyrus went up, taking with him Tissaphernes as his\n\nfriend, and accompanied also by a body of Hellenes, three hundred\n\nheavy armed men, under the command of Xenias the Parrhasian (1).\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) Parrhasia, a district and town in the south-west of Arcadia.\n\n<br/><br/>\nNow when Darius was dead, and Artaxerxes was established in the\n\nkingdom, Tissaphernes brought slanderous accusations against Cyrus\n\nbefore his brother, the king, of harbouring designs against him. And\n\nArtaxerxes, listening to the words of Tissaphernes, laid hands upon\n\nCyrus, desiring to put him to death; but his mother made intercession\n\nfor him, and sent him back again in safety to his province. He then,\n\nhaving so escaped through peril and dishonour, fell to considering,\n\nnot only how he might avoid ever again being in his brother's power,\n\nbut how, if possible, he might become king in his stead. Parysatis,\n\nhis mother, was his first resource; for she had more love for Cyrus\n\nthan for Artaxerxes upon his throne. Moreover Cyrus's behaviour\n\ntowards all who came to him from the king's court was such that, when\n\nhe sent them away again, they were better friends to himself than to    5\n\nthe king his brother. Nor did he neglect the barbarians in his own\n\nservice; but trained them, at once to be capable as warriors and\n\ndevoted adherents of himself. Lastly, he began collecting his Hellenic\n\narmament, but with the utmost secrecy, so that he might take the king\n\nas far as might be at unawares.\n\n<br/><br/>\nThe manner in which he contrived the levying of the troops was as\n\nfollows: First, he sent orders to the commandants of garrisons in the\n\ncities (so held by him), bidding them to get together as large a body\n\nof picked Peloponnesian troops as they severally were able, on the\n", "plea that Tissaphernes was plotting against their cities; and truly\n\nthese cities of Ionia had originally belonged to Tissaphernes, being\n\ngiven to him by the king; but at this time, with the exception of\n\nMiletus, they had all revolted to Cyrus. In Miletus, Tissaphernes,\n\nhaving become aware of similar designs, had forestalled the\n\nconspirators by putting some to death and banishing the remainder.\n\nCyrus, on his side, welcomed these fugitives, and having collected an\n\narmy, laid siege to Miletus by sea and land, endeavouring to reinstate\n\nthe exiles; and this gave him another pretext for collecting an\n\narmament. At the same time he sent to the king, and claimed, as being\n\nthe king's brother, that these cities should be given to himself\n\nrather than that Tissaphernes should continue to govern them; and in\n\nfurtherance of this end, the queen, his mother, co-operated with him,\n\nso that the king not only failed to see the design against himself,\n\nbut concluded that Cyrus was spending his money on armaments in order\n\nto make war on Tissaphernes. Nor did it pain him greatly to see the\n\ntwo at war together, and the less so because Cyrus was careful to\n\nremit the tribute due to the king from the cities which belonged to\n\nTissaphernes.\n\n<br/><br/>\nA third army was being collected for him in the Chersonese, over\n\nagainst Abydos, the origin of which was as follows: There was a\n\nLacedaemonian exile, named Clearchus, with whom Cyrus had become\n\nassociated. Cyrus admired the man, and made him a present of ten\n\nthousand darics (2). Clearchus took the gold, and with the money raised  9\n\nan army, and using the Chersonese as his base of operations, set to\n\nwork to fight the Thracians north of the Hellespont, in the interests\n\nof the Hellenes, and with such happy result that the Hellespontine\n\ncities, of their own accord, were eager to contribute funds for the\n\nsupport of his troops. In this way, again, an armament was being\n", "secretly maintained for Cyrus.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (2) A Persian gold coin = 125.55 grains of gold.\n\n<br/><br/>\nThen there was the Thessalian Aristippus, Cyrus's friend (3), who,\n\nunder pressure of the rival political party at home, had come to Cyrus\n\nand asked him for pay for two thousand mercenaries, to be continued\n\nfor three months, which would enable him, he said, to gain the upper\n\nhand of his antagonists. Cyrus replied by presenting him with six\n\nmonths' pay for four thousand mercenaries--only stipulating that\n\nAristippus should not come to terms with his antagonists without final\n\nconsultation with himself. In this way he secured to himself the\n\nsecret maintenance of a fourth armament.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (3) Lit. \"guest-friend.\" Aristippus was, as we learn from the \"Meno\"\n\n    of Plato, a native of Larisa, of the family of the Aleuadae, and a\n\n    pupil of Gorgias. He was also a lover of Menon, whom he appears to\n\n    have sent on this expedition instead of himself.\n\n<br/><br/>\nFurther, he bade Proxenus, a Boeotian, who was another friend, get\n\ntogether as many men as possible, and join him in an expedition which\n\nhe meditated against the Pisidians (4), who were causing annoyance to\n\nhis territory. Similarly two other friends, Sophaenetus the\n\nStymphalian (5), and Socrates the Achaean, had orders to get together\n\nas many men as possible and come to him, since he was on the point of\n\nopening a campaign, along with Milesian exiles, against Tissaphernes.\n\nThese orders were duly carried out by the officers in question.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (4) Lit. \"into the country of the Pisidians.\"\n\n<br/><br/>", " (5) Of Stymphalus in Arcadia.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nII\n\n<br/><br/>\nBut when the right moment seemed to him to have come, at which he       1\n\nshould begin his march into the interior, the pretext which he put\n\nforward was his desire to expel the Pisidians utterly out of the\n\ncountry; and he began collecting both his Asiatic and his Hellenic\n\narmaments, avowedly against that people. From Sardis in each direction\n\nhis orders sped: to Clearchus, to join him there with the whole of his\n\narmy; to Aristippus, to come to terms with those at home, and to\n\ndespatch to him the troops in his employ; to Xenias the Arcadian, who\n\nwas acting as general-in-chief of the foreign troops in the cities, to\n\npresent himself with all the men available, excepting only those who\n\nwere actually needed to garrison the citadels. He next summoned the\n\ntroops at present engaged in the siege of Miletus, and called upon the\n\nexiles to follow him on his intended expedition, promising them that\n\nif he were successful in his object, he would not pause until he had\n\nreinstated them in their native city. To this invitation they\n\nhearkened gladly; they believed in him; and with their arms they\n\npresented themselves at Sardis. So, too, Xenias arrived at Sardis with\n\nthe contingent from the cities, four thousand hoplites; Proxenus,\n\nalso, with fifteen hundred hoplites and five hundred light-armed\n\ntroops; Sophaenetus the Stymphalian, with one thousand hoplites;\n\nSocrates the Achaean, with five hundred hoplites; while the Megarion\n\nPasion came with three hundred hoplites and three hundred peltasts (1).\n\nThis latter officer, as well as Socrates, belonged to the force\n", "engaged against Miletus. These all joined him at Sardis.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) \"Targeteers\" armed with a light shield instead of the larger one\n\n    of the hoplite, or heavy infantry soldier. Iphicrates made great\n\n    use of this arm at a later date.\n\n<br/><br/>\nBut Tissaphernes did not fail to note these proceedings. An equipment\n\nso large pointed to something more than an invasion of Pisidia: so he\n\nargued; and with what speed he might, he set off to the king, attended\n\nby about five hundred horse. The king, on his side, had no sooner\n\nheard from Tissaphernes of Cyrus's great armament, than he began to\n\nmake counter-preparations.\n\n<br/><br/>\nThus Cyrus, with the troops which I have named, set out from Sardis,\n\nand marched on and on through Lydia three stages, making\n\ntwo-and-twenty parasangs (2), to the river Maeander. That river is two\n\nhundred feet (3) broad, and was spanned by a bridge consisting of seven\n\nboats. Crossing it, he marched through Phrygia a single stage, of\n\neight parasangs, to Colossae, an inhabited city (4), prosperous and      6\n\nlarge. Here he remained seven days, and was joined by Menon the\n\nThessalian, who arrived with one thousand hoplites and five hundred\n\npeltasts, Dolopes, Aenianes, and Olynthians. From this place he\n\nmarched three stages, twenty parasangs in all, to Celaenae, a populous\n\ncity of Phrygia, large and prosperous. Here Cyrus owned a palace and a\n\nlarge park (5) full of wild beasts, which he used to hunt on horseback,\n\nwhenever he wished to give himself or his horses exercise. Through the\n\nmidst of the park flows the river Maeander, the sources of which are\n\nwithin the palace buildings, and it flows through the city of\n\nCelaenae. The great king also has a palace in Celaenae, a strong\n\nplace, on the sources of another river, the Marsyas, at the foot of\n", "the acropolis. This river also flows through the city, discharging\n\nitself into the Maeander, and is five-and-twenty feet broad. Here is\n\nthe place where Apollo is said to have flayed Marsyas, when he had\n\nconquered him in the contest of skill. He hung up the skin of the\n\nconquered man, in the cavern where the spring wells forth, and hence\n\nthe name of the river, Marsyas. It was on this site that Xerxes, as\n\ntradition tells, built this very palace, as well as the citadel of\n\nCelaenae itself, on his retreat from Hellas, after he had lost the\n\nfamous battle. Here Cyrus remained for thirty days, during which\n\nClearchus the Lacedaemonian arrived with one thousand hoplites and\n\neight hundred Thracian peltasts and two hundred Cretan archers. At the\n\nsame time, also, came Sosis the Syracusian with three thousand\n\nhoplites, and Sophaenetus the Arcadian (6) with one thousand hoplites;\n\nand here Cyrus held a review, and numbered his Hellenes in the park,\n\nand found that they amounted in all to eleven thousand hoplites and\n\nabout two thousand peltasts.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (2) The Persian \"farsang\" = 30 stades, nearly 1 league, 3 1/2 statute\n\n    miles, though not of uniform value in all parts of Asia.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (3) \"Two plethra\": the plethron = about 101 English feet.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (4) Lit. \"inhabited,\" many of the cities of Asia being then as now\n\n    deserted, but the suggestion is clearly at times \"thickly\n\n    inhabited,\" \"populous.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\n (5) Lit. \"paradise,\" an oriental word = park or pleasure ground.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (6) Perhaps this should be Agias the Arcadian, as Mr. Macmichael\n\n    suggests. Sophaenetus has already been named above.\n", "<br/><br/>\nFrom this place he continued his march two stages--ten parasangs--to    10\n\nthe populous city of Peltae, where he remained three days; while\n\nXenias, the Arcadian, celebrated the Lycaea (7) with sacrifice, and\n\ninstituted games. The prizes were headbands of gold; and Cyrus himself\n\nwas a spectator of the contest. From this place the march was\n\ncontinued two stages--twelve parasangs--to Ceramon-agora, a populous\n\ncity, the last on the confines of Mysia. Thence a march of three\n\nstages--thirty parasangs--brought him to Caystru-pedion (8), a populous\n\ncity. Here Cyrus halted five days; and the soldiers, whose pay was now\n\nmore than three months in arrear, came several times to the palace\n\ngates demanding their dues; while Cyrus put them off with fine words\n\nand expectations, but could not conceal his vexation, for it was not\n\nhis fashion to stint payment, when he had the means. At this point\n\nEpyaxa, the wife of Syennesis, the king of the Cilicians, arrived on a\n\nvisit to Cyrus; and it was said that Cyrus received a large gift of\n\nmoney from the queen. At this date, at any rate, Cyrus gave the army\n\nfour months' pay. The queen was accompanied by a bodyguard of\n\nCilicians and Aspendians; and, if report speaks truly, Cyrus had\n\nintimate relations with the queen.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (7) The Lycaea, an Arcadian festival in honour of Zeus {Arcaios}, akin\n\n    to the Roman Lupercalia, which was originally a shepherd festival,\n\n    the introduction of which the Romans ascribe to the Arcadian\n\n    Evander.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (8) Lit. \"plain of the Cayster,\" like Ceramon-agora, \"the market of\n\n    the Ceramians\" above, the name of a town.\n\n<br/><br/>\nFrom this place he marched two stages--ten parasangs--to Thymbrium, a\n", "populous city. Here, by the side of the road, is the spring of Midas,\n\nthe king of Phrygia, as it is called, where Midas, as the story goes,\n\ncaught the satyr by drugging the spring with wine. From this place he\n\nmarched two stages--ten parasangs--to Tyriaeum, a populous city. Here\n\nhe halted three days; and the Cilician queen, according to the popular\n\naccount, begged Cyrus to exhibit his armament for her amusement. The\n\nlatter being only too glad to make such an exhibition, held a review\n\nof the Hellenes and barbarians in the plain. He ordered the Hellenes\n\nto draw up their lines and post themselves in their customary battle\n\norder, each general marshalling his own battalion. Accordingly they\n\ndrew up four-deep. The right was held by Menon and those with him; the  15\n\nleft by Clearchus and his men; the centre by the remaining generals\n\nwith theirs. Cyrus first inspected the barbarians, who marched past in\n\ntroops of horses and companies of infantry. He then inspected the\n\nHellenes; driving past them in his chariot, with the queen in her\n\ncarriage. And they all had brass helmets and purple tunics, and\n\ngreaves, and their shields uncovered (9).\n\n<br/><br/>\n (9) I.e. ready for action, c.f. \"bayonets fixed\".\n\n<br/><br/>\nAfter he had driven past the whole body, he drew up his chariot in\n\nfront of the centre of the battle-line, and sent his interpreter\n\nPigres to the generals of the Hellenes, with orders to present arms\n\nand to advance along the whole line. This order was repeated by the\n\ngenerals to their men; and at the sound of the bugle, with shields\n\nforward and spears in rest, they advanced to meet the enemy. The pace\n\nquickened, and with a shout the soldiers spontaneously fell into a\n\nrun, making in the direction of the camp. Great was the panic of the\n\nbarbarians. The Cilician queen in her carriage turned and fled; the\n\nsutlers in the marketing place left their wares and took to their\n", "heels; and the Hellenes meanwhile came into camp with a roar of\n\nlaughter. What astounded the queen was the brilliancy and order of the\n\narmament; but Cyrus was pleased to see the terror inspired by the\n\nHellenes in the hearts of the Asiatics.\n\n<br/><br/>\nFrom this place he marched on three stages--twenty parasangs--to\n\nIconium, the last city of Phrygia, where he remained three days.\n\nThence he marched through Lycaonia five stages--thirty parasangs. This\n\nwas hostile country, and he gave it over to the Hellenes to pillage.\n\nAt this point Cyrus sent back the Cilician queen to her own country by\n\nthe quickest route; and to escort her he sent the soldiers of Menon,\n\nand Menon himself. With the rest of the troops he continued his march\n\nthrough Cappadocia four stages--twenty-five parasangs--to Dana, a\n\npopulous city, large and flourishing. Here they halted three days,\n\nwithin which interval Cyrus put to death, on a charge of conspiracy, a\n\nPersian nobleman named Megaphernes, a wearer of the royal purple; and\n\nalong with him another high dignitary among his subordinate\n\ncommanders.\n\n<br/><br/>\nFrom this place they endeavoured to force a passage into Cilicia. Now   21\n\nthe entrance was by an exceedingly steep cart-road, impracticable for\n\nan army in face of a resisting force; and report said that Syennesis\n\nwas on the summit of the pass guarding the approach. Accordingly they\n\nhalted a day in the plain; but next day came a messenger informing\n\nthem that Syenesis had left the pass; doubtless, after perceiving that\n\nMenon's army was already in Cilicia on his own side of the mountains;\n\nand he had further been informed that ships of war, belonging to the\n\nLacedaemonians and to Cyrus himself, with Tamos on board as admiral,\n\nwere sailing round from Ionia to Cilicia. Whatever the reason might\n\nbe, Cyrus made his way up into the hills without let or hindrance, and\n", "came in sight of the tents where the Cilicians were on guard. From\n\nthat point he descended gradually into a large and beautiful plain\n\ncountry, well watered, and thickly covered with trees of all sorts and\n\nvines. This plain produces sesame plentifully, as also panic and\n\nmillet and barley and wheat; and it is shut in on all sides by a steep\n\nand lofty wall of mountains from sea to sea. Descending through this\n\nplain country, he advanced four stages--twenty-five parasangs--to\n\nTarsus, a large and prosperous city of Cilicia. Here stood the palace\n\nof Syennesis, the king of the country; and through the middle of the\n\ncity flows a river called the Cydnus, two hundred feet broad. They\n\nfound that the city had been deserted by its inhabitants, who had\n\nbetaken themselves, with Syennesis, to a strong place on the hills.\n\nAll had gone, except the tavern-keepers. The sea-board inhabitants of\n\nSoli and Issi also remained. Now Epyaxa, Syennesis's queen, had\n\nreached Tarsus five days in advance of Cyrus. During their passage\n\nover the mountains into the plain, two companies of Menon's army were\n\nlost. Some said they had been cut down by the Cilicians, while engaged\n\non some pillaging affair; another account was that they had been left\n\nbehind, and being unable to overtake the main body, or discover the\n\nroute, had gone astray and perished. However it was, they numbered one\n\nhundred hoplites; and when the rest arrived, being in a fury at the\n\ndestruction of their fellow soldiers, they vented their spleen by\n\npillaging the city of Tarsus and the palace to boot. Now when Cyrus\n\nhad marched into the city, he sent for Syennesis to come to him; but    26\n\nthe latter replied that he had never yet put himself into the hands of\n\nany one who was his superior, nor was he willing to accede to the\n\nproposal of Cyrus now; until, in the end, his wife persuaded him, and\n\nhe accepted pledges of good faith. After this they met, and Syennesis\n\ngave Cyrus large sums in aid of his army; while Cyrus presented him\n\nwith the customary royal gifts--to wit, a horse with a gold bit, a\n", "necklace of gold, a gold bracelet, and a gold scimitar, a Persian\n\ndress, and lastly, the exemption of his territory from further\n\npillage, with the privilege of taking back the slaves that had been\n\nseized, wherever they might chance to come upon them.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nIII\n\n<br/><br/>\nAt Tarsus Cyrus and his army halted for twenty days; the soldiers       1\n\nrefusing to advance further, since the suspicion ripened in their\n\nminds, that the expedition was in reality directed against the king;\n\nand as they insisted, they had not engaged their services for that\n\nobject. Clearchus set the example of trying to force his men to\n\ncontinue their march; but he had no sooner started at the head of his\n\ntroops than they began to pelt him and his baggage train, and\n\nClearchus had a narrow escape of being stoned to death there and then.\n\nLater on, when he perceived that force was useless, he summoned an\n\nassembly of his own men; and for a long while he stood and wept, while\n\nthe men gazed in silent astonishment. At last he spoke as follows:\n\n\"Fellow soldiers, do not marvel that I am sorely distressed on account\n\nof the present troubles. Cyrus has been no ordinary friend to me. When\n\nI was in banishment he honoured me in various ways, and made me also a\n\npresent of ten thousand darics. These I accepted, but not to lay them\n\nup for myself for private use; not to squander them in pleasure, but\n\nto expend them on yourselves. And, first of all, I went to war with\n\nthe Thracians, and with you to aid, I wreaked vengeance on them in\n\nbehalf of Hellas; driving them out of the Chersonese, when they wanted\n\nto deprive its Hellenic inhabitants of their lands. But as soon as\n", "Cyrus summoned me, I took you with me and set out, so that, if my\n\nbenefactor had any need of me, I might requite him for the good\n\ntreatment I myself had received at his hands.... But since you are\n\nnot minded to continue the march with me, one of two things is left to  5\n\nme to do; either I must renounce you for the sake of my friendship\n\nwith Cyrus, or I must go with you at the cost of deceiving him.\n\nWhether I am about to do right or not, I cannot say, but I choose\n\nyourselves; and, whatever betide, I mean to share your fate. Never\n\nshall it be said of me by any one that, having led Greek troops\n\nagainst the barbarians (1), I betrayed the Hellenes, and chose the\n\nfriendship of the barbarian. No! since you do not choose to obey and\n\nfollow me, I will follow after you. Whatever betide, I will share your\n\nfate. I look upon you as my country, my friends, my allies; with you I\n\nthink I shall be honoured, wherever I be; without you I do not see how\n\nI can help a friend or hurt a foe. My decision is taken. Wherever you\n\ngo, I go also.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) Lit. \"into the country of the barbarian.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nSuch were his words. But the soldiers, not only his own, but the rest\n\nalso, when they heard what he said, and how he had scouted the idea of\n\ngoing up to the great king's palace (2), expressed their approval; and\n\nmore than two thousand men deserted Xenias and Pasion, and took their\n\narms and baggage-train, and came and encamped with Clearchus. But\n\nCyrus, in despair and vexation at this turn of affairs, sent for\n\nClearchus. He refused to come; but, without the knowledge of the\n\nsoldiers, sent a message to Cyrus, bidding him keep a good heart, for\n\nthat all would arrange itself in the right way; and bade him keep on\n\nsending for him, whilst he himself refused to go. After that he got\n\ntogether his own men, with those who had joined him, and of the rest\n", "any who chose to come, and spoke as follows: \"Fellow soldiers, it is\n\nclear that the relations of Cyrus to us are identical with ours to\n\nhim. We are no longer his soldiers, since we have ceased to follow\n\nhim; and he, on his side, is no longer our paymaster. He, however, no\n\ndoubt considers himself wronged by us; and though he goes on sending\n\nfor me, I cannot bring myself to go to him: for two reasons, chiefly\n\nfrom a sense of shame, for I am forced to admit to myself that I have\n\naltogether deceived him; but partly, too, because I am afraid of his\n\nseizing me and inflicting a penalty on the wrongs which he conceives    11\n\nthat I have done him. In my opinion, then, this is no time for us to\n\ngo to sleep and forget all about ourselves, rather it is high time to\n\ndeliberate on our next move; and as long as we do remain here, we had\n\nbetter bethink us how we are to abide in security; or, if we are\n\nresolved to turn our backs at once, what will be the safest means of\n\nretreat; and, further, how we are to procure supplies, for without\n\nsupplies there is no profit whatsoever in the general or the private\n\nsoldier. The man with whom we have to deal is an excellent friend to\n\nhis friends, but a very dangerous enemy to his foes. And he is backed\n\nby a force of infantry and cavalry and ships such as we all alike very\n\nwell see and know, since we can hardly be said to have posted\n\nourselves at any great distance from him. If, then, any one has a\n\nsuggestion to make, now is the time to speak.\" With these words he\n\nceased.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (2) Or \"how he insisted that he was not going up.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nThen various speakers stood up; some of their own motion to propound\n\ntheir views; others inspired by Clearchus to dilate on the hopeless\n\ndifficulty of either staying, or going back without the goodwill of\n\nCyrus. One of these, in particular, with a make-believe of anxiety to\n", "commence the homeward march without further pause, called upon them\n\ninstantly to choose other generals, if Clearchus were not himself\n\nprepared to lead them back: \"Let them at once purchase supplies\" (the\n\nmarket being in the heart of the Asiatic camp), \"let them pack up\n\ntheir baggage: let them,\" he added, \"go to Cyrus and ask for some\n\nships in order to return by sea: if he refused to give them ships, let\n\nthem demand of him a guide to lead them back through a friendly\n\ndistrict; and if he would not so much as give them a guide, they could\n\nbut put themselves, without more ado, in marching order, and send on a\n\ndetachment to occupy the pass--before Cyrus and the Cilicians, whose\n\nproperty,\" the speaker added, \"we have so plentifully pillaged, can\n\nanticipate us.\" Such were the remarks of that speaker; he was followed\n\nby Clearchus, who merely said: \"As to my acting personally as general\n\nat this season, pray do not propose it: I can see numerous obstacles\n\nto my doing so. Obedience, in the fullest, I can render to the man of   15\n\nyour choice, that is another matter: and you shall see and know that I\n\ncan play my part, under command, with the best of you.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nAfter Clearchus another spokesman stood up, and proceeded to point out\n\nthe simplicity of the speaker, who proposed to ask for vessels, just\n\nas if Cyrus were minded to renounce the expedition and sail back\n\nagain. \"And let me further point out,\" he said, \"what a simple-minded\n\nnotion it is to beg a guide of the very man whose designs we are\n\nmarring. If we can trust any guide whom Cyrus may vouchsafe to us, why\n\nnot order Cyrus at once to occupy the pass on our behoof? For my part,\n\nI should think twice before I set foot on any ships that he might give\n\nus, for fear lest he should sink them with his men-of-war; and I\n\nshould equally hesitate to follow any guide of his: he might lead us\n\ninto some place out of which we should find it impossible to escape. I\n\nshould much prefer, if I am to return home against the will of Cyrus\n", "at all, to give him the slip, and so begone: which indeed is\n\nimpossible. But these schemes are simply nonsensical. My proposal is\n\nthat a deputation of fit persons, with Clearchus, should go to Cyrus:\n\nlet them go to Cyrus and ask him: what use he proposes to make of us?\n\nand if the business is at all similar to that on which he once before\n\nemployed a body of foreigners--let us by all means follow: let us show\n\nthat we are the equals of those who accompanied him on his march up\n\nformerly. But if the design should turn out to be of larger import\n\nthan the former one--involving more toil and more danger--we should\n\nask him, either to give us good reasons for following his lead, or\n\nelse consent to send us away into a friendly country. In this way,\n\nwhether we follow him, we shall do so as friends, and with heart and\n\nsoul, or whether we go back, we shall do so in security. The answer to\n\nthis shall be reported to us here, and when we have heard it, we will\n\nadvise as to our best course.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nThis resolution was carried, and they chose and sent a deputation with\n\nClearchus, who put to Cyrus the questions which had been agreed upon\n\nby the army. Cyrus replied as follows: That he had received news that\n\nAbrocomas, an enemy of his, was posted on the Euphrates, twelve stages  20\n\noff; his object was to march against this aforesaid Abrocomas: and if\n\nhe were still there, he wished to inflict punishment on him, \"or if he\n\nbe fled\" (so the reply concluded), \"we will there deliberate on the\n\nbest course.\" The deputation received the answer and reported it to\n\nthe soldiers. The suspicion that he was leading them against the king\n\nwas not dispelled; but it seemed best to follow him. They only\n\ndemanded an increase of pay, and Cyrus promised to give them half as\n\nmuch again as they had hitherto received--that is to say, a daric and\n\na half a month to each man, instead of a daric. Was he really leading\n\nthem to attack the king? Not even at this moment was any one apprised\n", "of the fact, at any rate in any open and public manner.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nIV\n\n<br/><br/>\nFrom this point he marched two stages--ten parasangs--to the river      1\n\nPsarus, which is two hundred feet broad, and from the Psarus he\n\nmarched a single stage--five parasangs--to Issi, the last city in\n\nCilicia. It lies on the seaboard--a prosperous, large and flourishing\n\ntown. Here they halted three days, and here Cyrus was joined by his\n\nfleet. There were thirty-five ships from Peloponnesus, with the\n\nLacedaemonian admiral Pythagoras on board. These had been piloted from\n\nEphesus by Tamos the Egyptian, who himself had another fleet of\n\ntwenty-five ships belonging to Cyrus. These had formed Tamos's\n\nblockading squadron at Miletus, when that city sided with\n\nTissaphernes; he had also used them in other military services\n\nrendered to Cyrus in his operations against that satrap. There was a\n\nthird officer on board the fleet, the Lacedaemonian Cheirisophus, who\n\nhad been sent for by Cyrus, and had brought with him seven hundred\n\nhoplites, over whom he was to act as general in the service of Cyrus.\n\nThe fleet lay at anchor opposite Cyrus's tent. Here too another\n\nreinforcement presented itself. This was a body of four hundred\n\nhoplites, Hellenic mercenaries in the service of Abrocomas, who         3\n\ndeserted him for Cyrus, and joined in the campaign against the king.\n\n<br/><br/>\nFrom Issi, he marched a single stage--five parasangs--to the gates of\n\nCilicia and Syria. This was a double fortress: the inner and nearer\n\none, which protects Cilicia, was held by Syennesis and a garrison of\n", "Cilicians; the outer and further one, protecting Syria, was reported\n\nto be garrisoned by a body of the king's troops. Through the gap\n\nbetween the two fortresses flows a river named the Carsus, which is a\n\nhundred feet broad, and the whole space between was scarcely more than\n\nsix hundred yards. To force a passage here would be impossible, so\n\nnarrow was the pass itself, with the fortification walls stretching\n\ndown to the sea, and precipitous rocks above; while both fortresses\n\nwere furnished with gates. It was the existence of this pass which had\n\ninduced Cyrus to send for the fleet, so as to enable him to lead a\n\nbody of hoplites inside and outside the gates; and so to force a\n\npassage through the enemy, if he were guarding the Syrian gate, as he\n\nfully expected to find Abrocomas doing with a large army. This,\n\nhowever, Abrocomas had not done; but as soon as he learnt that Cyrus\n\nwas in Cilicia, he had turned round and made his exit from Phoenicia,\n\nto join the king with an army amounting, as report said, to three\n\nhundred thousand men.\n\n<br/><br/>\nFrom this point Cyrus pursued his march, through Syria a single\n\nstage--five parasangs--to Myriandus, a city inhabited by Phoenicians,\n\non the sea-coast. This was a commercial port, and numerous merchant\n\nvessels were riding at anchor in the harbour. Here they halted seven\n\ndays, and here Xenias the Arcadian general, and Pasion the Megarian\n\ngot on board a trader, and having stowed away their most valuable\n\neffects, set sail for home; most people explained the act as the\n\noutcome of a fit of jealousy, because Cyrus had allowed Clearchus to\n\nretain their men, who had deserted to him, in hopes of returning to\n\nHellas instead of marching against the king; when the two had so\n\nvanished, a rumour spread that Cyrus was after them with some ships of\n\nwar, and some hoped the cowards might be caught, others pitied them,\n\nif that should be their fate.\n", "<br/><br/>\nBut Cyrus summoned the generals and addressed them: \"Xenias and         8\n\nPasion,\" he said, \"have taken leave of us; but they need not flatter\n\nthemselves that in so doing they have stolen into hiding. I know where\n\nthey are gone; nor will they owe their escape to speed; I have\n\nmen-of-war to capture their craft, if I like. But heaven help me! if I\n\nmean to pursue them: never shall it be said of me, that I turn people\n\nto account as long as they stay with me, but as soon as they are\n\nminded to be off, I seize and maltreat them, and strip them of their\n\nwealth. Not so! let them go with the consciousness that our behaviour\n\nto them is better than theirs to us. And yet I have their children and\n\nwives safe under lock and key in Tralles; but they shall not be\n\ndeprived even of these. They shall receive them back in return for\n\ntheir former goodness to me.\" So he spoke, and the Hellenes, even\n\nthose who had been out of heart at the thought of marching up the\n\ncountry, when they heard of the nobleness of Cyrus, were happier and\n\nmore eager to follow him on his path.\n\n<br/><br/>\nAfter this Cyrus marched onwards four stages--twenty parasangs--to the\n\nriver Chalus. That river is a hundred feet broad, and is stocked with\n\ntame fish which the Syrians regard as gods, and will not suffer to be\n\ninjured--and so too the pigeons of the place. The villages in which\n\nthey encamped belonged to Parysatis, as part of her girdle money (1).\n\nFrom this point he marched on five stages--thirty parasangs--to the\n\nsources of the river Dardas, which is a hundred feet broad. Here stood\n\nthe palace of Belesys, the ruler of Syria, with its park--which was a\n\nvery large and beautiful one, and full of the products of all the\n\nseasons in their course. But Cyrus cut down the park and burnt the\n\npalace. Thence he marched on three stages--fifteen parasangs--to the\n\nriver Euphrates, which is nearly half a mile broad. A large and         11\n", "flourishing city, named Thapsacus, stands on its banks. Here they\n\nhalted five days, and here Cyrus sent for the generals of the\n\nHellenes, and told them that the advance was now to be upon Babylon,\n\nagainst the great king; he bade them communicate this information to\n\nthe soldiers and persuade them to follow. The generals called an\n\nassembly, and announced the news to the soldiers. The latter were\n\nindignant and angry with the generals, accusing them of having kept\n\nsecret what they had long known; and refused to go, unless such a\n\nbribe of money were given them as had been given to their\n\npredecessors, when they went up with Cyrus to the court of his father,\n\nnot as now to fight a battle, but on a peaceful errand--the visit of a\n\nson to his father by invitation. The demand was reported to Cyrus by\n\nthe generals, and he undertook to give each man five silver minae as\n\nsoon as Babylon was reached, and their pay in full, until he had\n\nsafely conveyed them back to Ionia again. In this manner the Hellenic\n\nforce were persuaded--that is to say, the majority of them. Menon,\n\nindeed, before it was clear what the rest of the soldiers would\n\ndo--whether, in fact they would follow Cyrus or not--collected his own\n\ntroops apart and made them the following speech; \"Men,\" he said, \"if\n\nyou will listen to me, there is a method by which, without risk or\n\ntoil, you may win the special favour of Cyrus beyond the rest of the\n\nsoldiers. You ask what it is I would have you to do? I will tell you.\n\nCyrus at this instant is begging the Hellenes to follow him to attack\n\nthe king. I say then: Cross the Euphrates at once, before it is clear\n\nwhat answer the rest will make; if they vote in favour of following,\n\nyou will get the credit of having set the example, and Cyrus will be\n\ngrateful to you. He will look upon you as being the heartiest in his\n\ncause; he will repay, as of all others he best knows how; while, if\n\nthe rest vote against crossing, we shall go back again; but as the\n\nsole adherents, whose fidelity he can altogether trust, it is you whom\n", "Cyrus will turn to account, as commandants of garrisons or captains of\n\ncompanies. You need only ask him for whatever you want, and you will\n\nget it from him, as being the friends of Cyrus.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) Cf. Plat. \"Alcib.\" i. 123 B. \"Why, I have been informed by a\n\n    credible person, who went up to the king (at Susa), that he passed\n\n    through a large tract of excellent land, extending for nearly a\n\n    day's journey, which the people of the country called the queen's\n\n    girdle, and another which they called her veil,\" etc. Olympiodorus\n\n    and the Scholiast both think that Plato here refers to Xenophon\n\n    and this passage of the \"Anabasis.\" Grote thinks it very probable\n\n    that Plato had in his mind Xenophon (either his \"Anabasis\" or\n\n    personal communications with him).\n\n<br/><br/>\nThe men heard and obeyed, and before the rest had given their answer,\n\nthey were already across. But when Cyrus perceived that Menon's troops  16\n\nhad crossed, he was well pleased, and he sent Glus to the division in\n\nquestion, with this message: \"Soldiers, accept my thanks at present;\n\neventually you shall thank me. I will see to that, or my name is not\n\nCyrus.\" The soldiers therefore could not but pray heartily for his\n\nsuccess; so high their hopes ran. But to Menon, it was said, he sent\n\ngifts with lordly liberality. This done, Cyrus proceeded to cross; and\n\nin his wake followed the rest of the armament to a man. As they\n\nforded, never a man was wetted above the chest: nor ever until this\n\nmoment, said the men of Thapascus, had the river been so crossed on\n\nfoot, boats had always been required; but these, at the present time,\n\nAbrocomas, in his desire to hinder Cyrus from crossing, had been at\n\npains to burn. Thus the passage was looked upon as a thing miraculous;\n\nthe river had manifestly retired before the face of Cyrus, like a\n\ncourtier bowing to his future king. From this place he continued his\n", "march through Syria nine stages--fifty parasangs--and they reached the\n\nriver Araxes. Here were several villages full of corn and wine; in\n\nwhich they halted three days, and provisioned the army.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nV\n\n<br/><br/>\nThence he marched on through Arabia, keeping the Euphrates on the       1\n\nright, five desert stages--thirty-five parasangs. In this region the\n\nground was one long level plain, stretching far and wide like the sea,\n\nfull of absinth; whilst all the other vegetation, whether wood or\n\nreed, was sweet scented like spice or sweet herb; there were no trees;\n\nbut there was wild game of all kinds--wild asses in greatest\n\nabundance, with plenty of ostriches; besides these, there were\n\nbustards and antelopes. These creatures were occasionally chased by\n\nthe cavalry. The asses, when pursued, would run forward a space, and\n\nthen stand still--their pace being much swifter than that of horses;\n\nand as soon as the horses came close, they went through the same\n\nperformance. The only way to catch them was for the riders to post\n\nthemselves at intervals, and to hunt them in relays, as it were. The\n\nflesh of those they captured was not unlike venison, only more tender.\n\nNo one was lucky enough to capture an ostrich. Some of the troopers\n\ndid give chase, but it had soon to be abandoned; for the bird, in its\n\neffort to escape, speedily put a long interval between itself and its   3\n\npursuers; plying its legs at full speed, and using its wings the while\n\nlike a sail. The bustards were not so hard to catch when started\n\nsuddenly; for they only take short flights, like partridges, and are\n\nsoon tired. Their flesh is delicious.\n", "<br/><br/>\nAs the army wended its way through this region, they reached the river\n\nMascas, which is one hundred feet in breadth. Here stood a big\n\ndeserted city called Corsote, almost literally environed by the\n\nstream, which flows round it in a circle. Here they halted three days\n\nand provisioned themselves. Thence they continued their march thirteen\n\ndesert stages--ninety parasangs--with the Euphrates still on their\n\nright, until they reached the Gates. On these marches several of the\n\nbaggage animals perished of hunger, for there was neither grass nor\n\ngreen herb, or tree of any sort; but the country throughout was\n\nbarren. The inhabitants make their living by quarrying millstones on\n\nthe river banks, which they work up and take to Babylon and sell,\n\npurchasing corn in exchange for their goods. Corn failed the army, and\n\nwas not to be got for money, except in the Lydian market open in\n\nCyrus's Asiatic army; where a kapithe of wheat or barley cost four\n\nshekels; the shekel being equal to seven and a half Attic obols,\n\nwhilst the kapithe is the equivalent of two Attic choeneces (1), dry\n\nmeasure, so that the soldiers subsisted on meat alone for the whole\n\nperiod. Some of the stages were very long, whenever they had to push\n\non to find water or fodder; and once they found themselves involved in\n\na narrow way, where the deep clay presented an obstacle to the\n\nprogress of the wagons. Cyrus, with the nobles about him, halted to\n\nsuperintend the operation, and ordered Glus and Pigres to take a body\n\nof barbarians and to help in extricating the wagons. As they seemed to\n\nbe slow about the business, he turned round angrily to the Persian\n\nnobles and bade them lend a hand to force the wagons out. Then, if\n\never, what goes to constitute one branch of good discipline, was to be\n\nwitnessed. Each of those addressed, just where he chanced to be         8\n\nstanding, threw off his purple cloak, and flung himself into the work\n\nwith as much eagerness as if it had been a charge for victory. Down a\n", "steep hill side they flew, with their costly tunics and embroidered\n\ntrousers--some with the circlets round their necks, and bracelets on\n\ntheir arms--in an instant, they had sprung into the miry clay, and in\n\nless time than one could have conceived, they had landed the wagons\n\nsafe on terra firma.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) The choenix = about 1 quart (or, according to others, 1 1/2 pint).\n\n    It was the minimum allowance of corn for a man, say a slave, per\n\n    diem. The Spartan was allowed at the public table 2 choenices a\n\n    day.\n\n<br/><br/>\nAltogether it was plain that Cyrus was bent on pressing on the march,\n\nand averse to stoppages, except where he halted for the sake of\n\nprovisioning or some other necessary object; being convinced that the\n\nmore rapidly he advanced, the less prepared for battle would he find\n\nthe king; while the slower his own progress, the larger would be the\n\nhostile army which he would find collected. Indeed, the attentive\n\nobserver could see, at a glance, that if the king's empire was strong\n\nin its extent of territory and the number of inhabitants, that\n\nstrength is compensated by an inherent weakness, dependent upon the\n\nlength of roads and the inevitable dispersion of defensive forces,\n\nwhere an invader insists upon pressing home the war by forced marches.\n\n<br/><br/>\nOn the opposite side of the Euphrates to the point reached on one of\n\nthese desert stages, was a large and flourishing city named Charmande.\n\nFrom this town the soldiers made purchases of provisions, crossing the\n\nriver on rafts, in the following fashion: They took the skins which\n\nthey used as tent coverings, and filled them with light grass; they\n\nthen compressed and stitched them tightly together by the ends, so\n\nthat the water might not touch the hay. On these they crossed and got\n", "provisions: wine made from the date-nut, and millet or panic-corn, the\n\ncommon staple of the country. Some dispute or other here occurred\n\nbetween the soldiers of Menon and Clearchus, in which Clearchus\n\nsentenced one of Menon's men, as the delinquent, and had him flogged.\n\nThe man went back to his own division and told them. Hearing what had\n\nbeen done to their comrade, his fellows fretted and fumed, and were\n\nhighly incensed against Clearchus. The same day Clearchus visited the\n\npassage of the river, and after inspecting the market there, was\n\nreturning with a few followers, on horseback, to his tent, and had to   12\n\npass through Menon's quarters. Cyrus had not yet come up, but was\n\nriding up in the same direction. One of Menon's men, who was splitting\n\nwood, caught sight of Clearchus as he rode past, and aimed a blow at\n\nhim with his axe. The aim took no effect; when another hurled a stone\n\nat him, and a third, and then several, with shouts and hisses.\n\nClearchus made a rapid retreat to his own troops, and at once ordered\n\nthem to get under arms. He bade his hoplites remain in position with\n\ntheir shields resting against their knees, while he, at the head of\n\nhis Thracians and horsemen, of which he had more than forty in his\n\narmy--Thracians for the most part--advanced against Menon's soldiers,\n\nso that the latter, with Menon himself, were panic-stricken, and ran\n\nto seize their arms; some even stood riveted to the spot, in\n\nperplexity at the occurrence. Just then Proxenus came up from behind,\n\nas chance would have it, with his division of hoplites, and without a\n\nmoment's hesitation marched into the open space between the rival\n\nparties, and grounded arms; then he fell to begging Clearchus to\n\ndesist. The latter was not too well pleased to hear his trouble mildly\n\nspoken of, when he had barely escaped being stoned to death; and he\n\nbade Proxenus retire and leave the intervening space open. At this\n\njuncture Cyrus arrived and inquired what was happening. There was no\n\ntime for hesitation. With his javelins firmly grasped in his hands he\n", "galloped up--escorted by some of his faithful bodyguard, who were\n\npresent--and was soon in the midst, exclaiming: \"Clearchus, Proxenus,\n\nand you other Hellenes yonder, you know not what you do. As surely as\n\nyou come to blows with one another, our fate is sealed--this very day\n\nI shall be cut to pieces, and so will you: your turn will follow close\n\non mine. Let our fortunes once take an evil turn, and these barbarians\n\nwhom you see around will be worse foes to us than those who are at\n\npresent serving the king.\" At these words Clearchus came to his\n\nsenses. Both parties paused from battle, and retired to their\n\nquarters: order reigned.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nVI\n\n<br/><br/>\nAs they advanced from this point (opposite Charmande), they came upon   1\n\nthe hoof-prints and dung of horses at frequent intervals. It looked\n\nlike the trail of some two thousand horses. Keeping ahead of the army,\n\nthese fellows burnt up the grass and everything else that was good for\n\nuse. Now there was a Persian, named Orontas; he was closely related to\n\nthe king by birth: and in matters pertaining to war reckoned among the\n\nbest of Persian warriors. Having formerly been at war with Cyrus, and\n\nafterwards reconciled to him, he now made a conspiracy to destroy him.\n\nhe made a proposal to Cyrus: if Cyrus would furnish him with a\n\nthousand horsemen, he would deal with these troopers, who were burning\n\ndown everything in front of them; he would lay an ambuscade and cut\n\nthem down, or he would capture a host of them alive; in any case, he\n\nwould put a stop to their aggressiveness and burnings; he would see to\n\nit that they did not ever get a chance of setting eyes on Cyrus's army\n", "and reporting its advent to the king. The proposal seemed plausible to\n\nCyrus, who accordingly authorised Orontas to take a detachment from\n\neach of the generals, and be gone. He, thinking that he had got his\n\nhorsemen ready to his hand, wrote a letter to the king, announcing\n\nthat he would ere long join him with as many troopers as he could\n\nbring; he bade him, at the same time, instruct the royal cavalry to\n\nwelcome him as a friend. The letter further contained certain\n\nreminders of his former friendship and fidelity. This despatch he\n\ndelivered into the hands of one who was a trusty messenger, as he\n\nthought; but the bearer took and gave it to Cyrus. Cyrus read it.\n\nOrontas was arrested. Then Cyrus summoned to his tent seven of the\n\nnoblest Persians among his personal attendants, and sent orders to the\n\nHellenic generals to bring up a body of hoplites. These troops were to\n\ntake up a position round his tent. This the generals did; bringing up\n\nabout three thousand hoplites. Clearchus was also invited inside, to\n\nassist at the court-martial; a compliment due to the position he held\n\namong the other generals, in the opinion not only of Cyrus, but also\n\nof the rest of the court. When he came out, he reported the\n\ncircumstances of the trial (as to which, indeed, there was no mystery)\n\nto his friends. He said that Cyrus opened the inquiry with these\n\nwords: \"I have invited you hither, my friends, that I may take advice\n\nwith you, and carry out whatever, in the sight of God and man, it is\n\nright for me to do, as concerning the man before you, Orontas. The      6\n\nprisoner was, in the first instance, given to me by my father, to be\n\nmy faithful subject. In the next place, acting, to use his own words,\n\nunder the orders of my brother, and having hold of the acropolis of\n\nSardis, he went to war with me. I met war with war, and forced him to\n\nthink it more prudent to desist from war with me: whereupon we shook\n\nhands, exchanging solemn pledges. After that,\" and at this point Cyrus\n\nturned to Orontas, and addressed him personally--\"after that, did I do\n", "you any wrong?\" Answer, \"Never.\" Again another question: \"Then later\n\non, having received, as you admit, no injury from me, did you revolt\n\nto the Mysians and injure my territory, as far as in you lay?\"--\"I\n\ndid,\" was the reply. \"Then, once more having discovered the limits of\n\nyour power, did you flee to the altar of Artemis, crying out that you\n\nrepented? and did you thus work upon my feelings, that we a second\n\ntime shook hands and made interchange of solemn pledges? Are these\n\nthings so?\" Orontas again assented. \"Then what injury have you\n\nreceived from me,\" Cyrus asked, \"that now for the third time, you have\n\nbeen detected in a treasonous plot against me?\"--\"I must needs do so,\"\n\nhe answered. Then Cyrus put one more question: \"But the day may come,\n\nmay it not, when you will once again be hostile to my brother, and a\n\nfaithful friend to myself?\" The other answered: \"Even if I were, you\n\ncould never be brought to believe it, Cyrus.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nAt this point Cyrus turned to those who were present and said: \"Such\n\nhas been the conduct of the prisoner in the past: such is his language\n\nnow. I now call upon you, and you first, Clearchus, to declare your\n\nopinion--what think you?\" And Clearchus answered: \"My advice to you is\n\nto put this man out of the way as soon as may be, so that we may be\n\nsaved the necessity of watching him, and have more leisure, as far as\n\nhe is concerned, to requite the services of those whose friendship is\n\nsincere.\"--\"To this opinion,\" he told us, \"the rest of the court\n\nadhered.\" After that, at the bidding of Cyrus, each of those present,   10\n\nin turn, including the kinsmen of Orontas, took him by the girdle;\n\nwhich is as much as to say, \"Let him die the death,\" and then those\n\nappointed led him out; and they who in old days were wont to do\n\nobeisance to him, could not refrain, even at that moment, from bowing\n\ndown before him, albeit they knew he was being led forth to death.\n\n<br/><br/>", "After they had conducted him to the tent of Artapates, the trustiest\n\nof Cyrus's wand-bearers, none set eyes upon him ever again, alive or\n\ndead. No one, of his own knowledge, could declare the manner of his\n\ndeath; though some conjectured one thing and some another. No tomb to\n\nmark his resting-place, either then or since, was ever seen.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nVII\n\n<br/><br/>\nFrom this place Cyrus marched through Babylonia three stages--twelve    1\n\nparasangs. Now, on the third stage, about midnight, Cyrus held a\n\nreview of the Hellenes and Asiatics in the plain, expecting that the\n\nking would arrive the following day with his army to offer battle. He\n\ngave orders to Clearchus to take command of the right wing, and to\n\nMenon the Thessalian of the left, while he himself undertook to the\n\ndisposition of his own forces in person. After the review, with the\n\nfirst approach of day, deserters from the great king arrived, bringing\n\nCyrus information about the royal army. Then Cyrus summoned the\n\ngenerals and captains of the Hellenes, and held a council of war to\n\narrange the plan of battle. He took this opportunity also to address\n\nthe following words of compliment and encouragement to the meeting:\n\n\"Men of Hellas,\" he said, \"it is certainly not from dearth of\n\nbarbarians to fight my battles that I put myself at your head as my\n\nallies; but because I hold you to be better and stronger than many\n\nbarbarians. That is why I took you. See then that you prove yourselves\n\nto be men worthy of the liberty which you possess, and which I envy\n\nyou. Liberty--it is a thing which, be well assured, I would choose in\n\npreference to all my other possessions, multiplied many times. But I\n", "would like you to know into what sort of struggle you are going: learn\n\nits nature from one who knows. Their numbers are great, and they come\n\non with much noise; but if you can hold out against these two things,\n\nI confess I am ashamed to think, what a sorry set of folk you will      4\n\nfind the inhabitants of this land to be. But you are men, and brave\n\nyou must be, being men: it is agreed; then if you wish to return home,\n\nany of you, I undertake to send you back, in such sort that your\n\nfriends at home shall envy you; but I flatter myself I shall persuade\n\nmany of you to accept what I will offer you here, in lieu of what you\n\nleft at home.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nHere Gaulites, a Samian exile, and a trusty friend of Cyrus, being\n\npresent, exclaimed: \"Ay, Cyrus, but some say you can afford to make\n\nlarge promises now, because you are in the crisis of impending danger;\n\nbut let matters go well with you, will you recollect? They shake their\n\nheads. Indeed, some add that, even if you did recollect, and were ever\n\nso willing, you would not be able to make good all your promises, and\n\nrepay.\" When Cyrus heard that, he answered: \"You forget, sirs, my\n\nfather's empire stretches southwards to a region where men cannot\n\ndwell by reason of the heat, and northwards to a region uninhabitable\n\nthrough cold; but all the intervening space is mapped out in satrapies\n\nbelonging to my brother's friends: so that if the victory be ours, it\n\nwill be ours also to put our friends in possession in their room. On\n\nthe whole my fear is, not that I may not have enough to give to each\n\nof my friends, but lest I may not have friends enough on whom to\n\nbestow what I have to give, and to each of you Hellenes I will give a\n\ncrown of gold.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nSo they, when they heard these words, were once more elated than ever\n\nthemselves, and spread the good news among the rest outside. And there\n", "came into his presence both the generals and some of the other\n\nHellenes also, claiming to know what they should have in the event of\n\nvictory; and Cyrus satisfied the expectations of each and all, and so\n\ndismissed them. Now the advice and admonition of all who came into\n\nconversation with him was, not to enter the battle himself, but to\n\npost himself in rear of themselves; and at this season Clearchus put a\n\nquestion to him: \"But do you think that your brother will give battle   9\n\nto you, Cyrus?\" and Cyrus answered: \"Not without a battle, be assured,\n\nshall the prize be won; if he be the son of Darius and Parysatis, and\n\na brother of mine.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nIn the final arming for battle at this juncture, the numbers were as\n\nfollows: Of Hellenes there were ten thousand four hundred heavy\n\ninfantry with two thousand five hundred targeteers, while the\n\nbarbarians with Cyrus reached a total of one hundred thousand. He had\n\ntoo about twenty scythe-chariots. The enemy's forces were reported to\n\nnumber one million two hundred thousand, with two hundred\n\nscythe-chariots, besides which he had six thousand cavalry under\n\nArtagerses. These formed the immediate vanguard of the king himself.\n\nThe royal army was marshalled by four generals or field-marshals, each\n\nin command of three hundred thousand men. Their names were Abrocomas,\n\nTissaphernes, Gobryas, and Arbaces. (But of this total not more than\n\nnine hundred thousand were engaged in the battle, with one hundred and\n\nfifty scythe-chariots; since Abrocomas, on his march from Phoenicia,\n\narrived five days too late for the battle.) Such was the information\n\nbrought to Cyrus by deserters who came in from the king's army before\n\nthe battle, and it was corroborated after the battle by those of the\n\nenemy who were taken prisoners.\n\n<br/><br/>\nFrom this place Cyrus advanced one stage--three parasangs--with the\n", "whole body of his troops, Hellenic and barbarian alike in order of\n\nbattle. He expected the king to give battle the same day, for in the\n\nmiddle of this day's march a deep sunk trench was reached, thirty feet\n\nbroad, and eighteen feet deep. The trench was carried inland through\n\nthe plain, twelve parasang's distance, to the wall of Media (1).  (Here\n\nare canals, flowing from the river Tigris; they are four in number,\n\neach a hundred feet broad, and very deep, with corn ships plying upon   15\n\nthem; they empty themselves into the Euphrates, and are at intervals\n\nof one parasang apart, and are spanned by bridges.)\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) For \"the wall of Media\" see Grote, \"Hist. of Greece,\" vol. ix. p.\n\n    87 and foll. note 1 (1st ed.), and various authorities there\n\n    quoted or referred to. The next passage enclosed in  () may\n\n    possibly be a commentator's or editor's note, but, on the whole, I\n\n    have thought it best to keep the words in the text instead of\n\n    relegating them, as heretofore, to a note. Perhaps some future\n\n    traveller may clear up all difficulties.\n\n<br/><br/>\nBetween the Euphrates and the trench was a narrow passage, twenty feet\n\nonly in breadth. The trench itself had been constructed by the great\n\nking upon hearing of Cyrus's approach, to serve as a line of defence.\n\nThrough this narrow passage then Cyrus and his army passed, and found\n\nthemselves safe inside the trench. So there was no battle to be fought\n\nwith the king that day; only there were numerous unmistakable traces\n\nof horse and infantry in retreat. Here Cyrus summoned Silanus, his\n\nAmbraciot soothsayer, and presented him with three thousand darics;\n\nbecause eleven days back, when sacrificing, he had told him that the\n\nking would not fight within ten days, and Cyrus had answered: \"Well,\n\nthen, if he does not fight within that time, he will not fight at all;\n\nand if your prophecy comes true, I promise you ten talents.\" So now,\n", "that the ten days were passed, he presented him with the above sum.\n\n<br/><br/>\nBut as the king had failed to hinder the passage of Cyrus's army at\n\nthe trench, Cyrus himself and the rest concluded that he must have\n\nabandoned the idea of offering battle, so that next day Cyrus advanced\n\nwith less than his former caution. On the third day he was conducting\n\nthe march, seated in his carriage, with only a small body of troops\n\ndrawn up in front of him. The mass of the army was moving on in no\n\nkind of order: the soldiers having consigned their heavy arms to be\n\ncarried in the wagons or on the backs of beasts.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nVIII\n\n<br/><br/>\nIt was already about full market time (1) and the halting-place at       1\n\nwhich the army was to take up quarters was nearly reached, when\n\nPategyas, a Persian, a trusty member of Cyrus's personal staff, came\n\ngalloping up at full speed on his horse, which was bathed in sweat,\n\nand to every one he met he shouted in Greek and Persian, as fast as he\n\ncould ejaculate the words: \"The king is advancing with a large army\n\nready for battle.\" Then ensued a scene of wild confusion. The Hellenes\n\nand all alike were expecting to be attacked on the instant, and before\n\nthey could form their lines. Cyrus sprang from his carriage and donned\n\nhis corselet; then leaping on to his charger's back, with the javelins\n\nfirmly clutched, he passed the order to the rest, to arm themselves\n\nand fall into their several ranks.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) I.e. between 9 and 10 A.M.\n", "<br/><br/>\nThe orders were carried out with alacrity; the ranks shaped\n\nthemselves. Clearchus held the right wing resting on the Euphrates,\n\nProxenus was next, and after him the rest, while Menon with his troops\n\nheld the Hellenic left. Of the Asiatics, a body of Paphlagonian\n\ncavalry, one thousand strong, were posted beside Clearchus on the\n\nright, and with them stood the Hellenic peltasts. On the left was\n\nAriaeus, Cyrus's second in command, and the rest of the barbarian\n\nhost. Cyrus was with his bodyguard of cavalry about six hundred\n\nstrong, all armed with corselets like Cyrus, and cuirasses and\n\nhelmets; but not so Cyrus: he went into battle with head\n\nunhelmeted (2). So too all the horses with Cyrus wore forehead-pieces\n\nand breast-pieces, and the troopers carried short Hellenic swords.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (2) The MSS. add, \"to expose oneself to the risks of war bareheaded\n\n    is, it is said, a practice common to the Persians,\" which I regard\n\n    as a commentator's note, if not an original marginal note of some\n\n    early editor, possibly of the author himself. The \"Cyropaedeia\" is\n\n    full of such comments, \"pieces justificatives\" inserted into the\n\n    text.\n\n<br/><br/>\nIt was now mid-day, and the enemy was not yet in sight; but with the\n\napproach of afternoon was seen dust like a white cloud, and after a\n\nconsiderable interval a black pall as it were spread far and high\n\nabove the plain. As they came nearer, very soon was seen here and\n\nthere a glint of bronze and spear-points; and the ranks could plainly\n\nbe distinguished. On the left were troopers wearing white cuirasses.\n\nThat is Tissaphernes in command, they said, and next to these a body\n\nof men bearing wicker-shields, and next again heavy-armed infantry,\n\nwith long wooden shields reaching to the feet. These were the\n", "Egyptians, they said, and then other cavalry, other bowmen; all were\n\nin national divisions, each nation marching in densely-crowded          10\n\nsquares. And all along their front was a line of chariots at\n\nconsiderable intervals from one another--the famous scythe-chariots,\n\nas they were named--having their scythes fitted to the axle-trees and\n\nstretching out slantwise, while others protruded under the\n\nchariot-seats, facing the ground, so as to cut through all they\n\nencountered. The design was to let them dash full speed into the ranks\n\nof the Hellenes and cut them through.\n\n<br/><br/>\nCuriously enough the anticipation of Cyrus, when at the council of war\n\nhe admonished the Hellenes not to mind the shouting of the Asiatics,\n\nwas not justified. Instead of shouting, they came on in deep silence,\n\nsoftly and slowly, with even tread. At this instant, Cyrus, riding\n\npast in person, accompanied by Pigres, his interpreter, and three or\n\nfour others, called aloud to Clearchus to advance against the enemy's\n\ncentre, for there the king was to be found: \"And if we strike home at\n\nthis point,\" he added, \"our work is finished.\" Clearchus, though he\n\ncould see the compact body at the centre, and had been told by Cyrus\n\nthat the king lay outside the Hellenic left (for, owing to numerical\n\nsuperiority, the king, while holding his own centre, could well\n\noverlap Cyrus's extreme left), still hesitated to draw off his right\n\nwing from the river, for fear of being turned on both flanks; and he\n\nsimply replied, assuring Cyrus that he would take care all went well.\n\n<br/><br/>\nAt this time the barbarian army was evenly advancing, and the Hellenic\n\ndivision was still riveted to the spot, completing its formation as\n\nthe various contingents came up. Cyrus, riding past at some distance\n\nfrom the lines, glanced his eye first in one direction and then in the\n\nother, so as to take a complete survey of friends and foes; when\n", "Xenophon the Athenian, seeing him, rode up from the Hellenic quarter\n\nto meet him, asking him whether he had any orders to give. Cyrus,\n\npulling up his horse, begged him to make the announcement generally\n\nknown that the omens from the victims, internal and external alike,\n\nwere good (3). While he was still speaking, he heard a confused murmur   16\n\npassing through the ranks, and asked what it meant. The other replied\n\nthat it was the watchword being passed down for the second time. Cyrus\n\nwondered who had given the order, and asked what the watchword was. On\n\nbeing told it was \"Zeus our Saviour and Victory,\" he replied, \"I\n\naccept it; so let it be,\" and with that remark rode away to his own\n\nposition. And now the two battle lines were no more than three or four\n\nfurlongs apart, when the Hellenes began chanting the paean, and at the\n\nsame time advanced against the enemy.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (3) I.e. the omens from inspecting the innards of the victims, and the\n\n    omens from the acts and movements of the victims.\n\n<br/><br/>\nBut with the forward movement a certain portion of the line curved\n\nonwards in advance, with wave-like sinuosity, and the portion left\n\nbehind quickened to a run; and simultaneously a thrilling cry burst\n\nfrom all lips, like that in honour of the war-god--eleleu! eleleu! and\n\nthe running became general. Some say they clashed their shields and\n\nspears, thereby causing terror to the horses (4); and before they had\n\ngot within arrowshot the barbarians swerved and took to flight. And\n\nnow the Hellenes gave chase with might and main, checked only by\n\nshouts to one another not to race, but to keep their ranks. The\n\nenemy's chariots, reft of their charioteers, swept onwards, some\n\nthrough the enemy themselves, others past the Hellenes. They, as they\n\nsaw them coming, opened a gap and let them pass. One fellow, like some\n\ndumbfoundered mortal on a racecourse, was caught by the heels, but\n", "even he, they said, received no hurt, nor indeed, with the single\n\nexception of some one on the left wing who was said to have been\n\nwounded by an arrow, did any Hellene in this battle suffer a single\n\nhurt.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (4) Some critics regard this sentence as an editor's or commentator's\n\n    note.\n\n<br/><br/>\nCyrus, seeing the Hellene's conquering, as far as they at any rate\n\nwere concerned, and in hot pursuit, was well content; but in spite of\n\nhis joy and the salutations offered him at that moment by those about   21\n\nhim, as though he were already king, he was not led away to join in\n\nthe pursuit, but keeping his squadron of six hundred horsemen in close\n\norder, waited and watched to see what the king himself would do. The\n\nking, he knew, held the centre of the Persian army. Indeed it is the\n\nfashion for the Asiatic monarch to occupy that position during action,\n\nfor this twofold reason: he holds the safest place, with his troops on\n\neither side of him, while, if he has occasion to despatch any\n\nnecessary rider along the lines, his troops will receive the message\n\nin half the time. The king accordingly on this occasion held the\n\ncentre of his army, but for all that, he was outside Cyrus's left\n\nwing; and seeing that no one offered him battle in front, nor yet the\n\ntroops in front of him, he wheeled as if to encircle the enemy. It was\n\nthen that Cyrus, in apprehension lest the king might get round to the\n\nrear and cut to pieces the Hellenic body, charged to meet him.\n\nAttacking with his six hundred, he mastered the line of troops in\n\nfront of the king, and put to flight the six thousand, cutting down,\n\nas is said, with his own hand their general, Artagerses.\n\n<br/><br/>\nBut as soon as the rout commenced, Cyrus's own six hundred themselves,\n", "in the ardour of pursuit, were scattered, with the exception of a\n\nhandful who were left with Cyrus himself--chiefly his table\n\ncompanions, so-called. Left alone with these, he caught sight of the\n\nking, and the close throng about him. Unable longer to contain\n\nhimself, with a cry, \"I see the man,\" he rushed at him and dealt a\n\nblow at his chest, wounding him through the corselet. This, according\n\nto the statement of Ctesias the surgeon (5), who further states that he\n\nhimself healed the wound. As Cyrus delivered the blow, some one struck\n\nhim with a javelin under the eye severely; and in the struggle which\n\nthen ensued between the king and Cyrus and those about them to protect\n\none or other, we have the statement of Ctesias as to the number slain   27\n\non the king's side, for he was by his side. On the other, Cyrus\n\nhimself fell, and eight of his bravest companions lay on the top of\n\nhim. The story says that Artapes, the trustiest among his\n\nwand-wearers, when he saw that Cyrus had fallen to the ground, leapt\n\nfrom his horse and threw his arms about him. Then, as one account\n\nsays, the king bade one slay him as a worthy victim to his brother:\n\nothers say that Artapates drew his scimitar and slew himself by his\n\nown hand. A golden scimitar it is true, he had; he wore also a collar\n\nand bracelets and the other ornaments such as the noblest Persians\n\nwear; for his kindliness and fidelity had won him honours at the hands\n\nof Cyrus.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (5) \"Ctesias, the son of Ctesiochus, was a physician of Cnidos.\n\n    Seventeen years of his life were passed at the court of Persia,\n\n    fourteen in the service of Darios, three in that of Artaxerxes; he\n\n    returned to Greece in 398 B.C.,\" and \"was employed by Artaxerxes\n\n    in diplomatic services.\" See Mure; also Ch. Muller, for his life\n\n    and works. He wrote (1) a history on Persian affairs in three\n\n    parts--Assyrian, Median, Persian--with a chapter \"On Tributes;\"\n", "    (2) a history of Indian affairs (written in the vein of Sir John\n\n    Maundeville, Kt.); (3) a Periplus; (4) a treatise on Mountains;\n\n    (5) a treatise on Rivers.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nIX\n\n<br/><br/>\nSo died Cyrus; a man the kingliest (1) and most worthy to rule of all    1\n\nthe Persians who have lived since the elder Cyrus: according to the\n\nconcurrent testimony of all who are reputed to have known him\n\nintimately. To begin from the beginning, when still a boy, and whilst\n\nbeing brought up with his brother and the other lads, his unrivalled\n\nexcellence was recognised. For the sons of the noblest Persians, it\n\nmust be known, are brought up, one and all, at the king's portals.\n\nHere lessons of sobriety and self-control may largely be laid to\n\nheart, while there is nothing base or ugly for eye or ear to feed\n\nupon. There is the daily spectacle ever before the boys of some\n\nreceiving honour from the king, and again of others receiving\n\ndishonour; and the tale of all this is in their ears, so that from\n\nearliest boyhood they learn how to rule and to be ruled.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) The character now to be drawn is afterwards elaborated into the\n\n    Cyrus of the Cyropaedeia.\n\n<br/><br/>\nIn this courtly training Cyrus earned a double reputation; first he\n\nwas held to be a paragon of modesty among his fellows, rendering an\n\nobedience to his elders which exceeded that of many of his own\n\ninferiors; and next he bore away the palm for skill in horsemanship\n", "and for love of the animal itself. Nor less in matters of war, in the\n\nuse of the bow and the javelin, was he held by men in general to be at  5\n\nonce the aptest of learners and the most eager practiser. As soon as\n\nhis age permitted, the same pre-eminence showed itself in his fondness\n\nfor the chase, not without a certain appetite for perilous adventure\n\nin facing the wild beasts themselves. Once a bear made a furious rush\n\nat him (2), and without wincing he grappled with her, and was pulled\n\nfrom his horse, receiving wounds the scars of which were visible\n\nthrough life; but in the end he slew the creature, nor did he forget\n\nhim who first came to his aid, but made him enviable in the eyes of\n\nmany.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (2) The elder Cyrus, when a boy, kills not a bear but a boar.\n\n<br/><br/>\nAfter he had been sent down by his father to be satrap of Lydia and\n\nGreat Phrygia and Cappadocia, and had been appointed general of the\n\nforces, whose business it is to muster in the plain of the Castolus,\n\nnothing was more noticeable in his conduct than the importance which\n\nhe attached to the faithful fulfilment of every treaty or compact or\n\nundertaking entered into with others. He would tell no lies to any\n\none. Thus doubtless it was that he won the confidence alike of\n\nindividuals and of the communities entrusted to his care; or in case\n\nof hostility, a treaty made with Cyrus was a guarantee sufficient to\n\nthe combatant that he would suffer nothing contrary to its terms.\n\nTherefore, in the war with Tissaphernes, all the states of their own\n\naccord chose Cyrus in lieu of Tissaphernes, except only the men of\n\nMiletus, and these were only alienated through fear of him, because he\n\nrefused to abandon their exiled citizens; and his deeds and words bore\n\nemphatic witness to his principle: even if they were weakened in\n\nnumber or in fortune, he would never abandon those who had once become\n", "his friends.\n\n<br/><br/>\nHe made no secret of his endeavour to outdo his friends and his foes\n\nalike in reciprocity of conduct. The prayer has been attributed to\n\nhim, \"God grant I may live along enough to recompense my friends and\n\nrequite my foes with a strong arm.\" However this may be, no one, at\n\nleast in our days, ever drew together so ardent a following of\n\nfriends, eager to lay at his feet their money, their cities, their own\n\nlives and persons; nor is it to be inferred from this that he suffered\n\nthe malefactor and the wrongdoer to laugh him to scorn; on the          13\n\ncontrary, these he punished most unflinchingly. It was no rare sight\n\nto see on the well-trodden highways, men who had forfeited hand or\n\nfoot or eye; the result being that throughout the satrapy of Cyrus any\n\none, Hellene or barbarian, provided he were innocent, might fearlessly\n\ntravel wherever he pleased, and take with him whatever he felt\n\ndisposed. However, as all allowed, it was for the brave in war that he\n\nreserved especial honour. To take the first instance to hand, he had a\n\nwar with the Pisidians and Mysians. Being himself at the head of an\n\nexpedition into those territories, he could observe those who\n\nvoluntarily encountered risks; these he made rulers of the territory\n\nwhich he subjected, and afterwards honoured them with other gifts. So\n\nthat, if the good and brave were set on a pinnacle of fortune, cowards\n\nwere recognised as their natural slaves; and so it befell that Cyrus\n\nnever had lack of volunteers in any service of danger, whenever it was\n\nexpected that his eye would be upon them.\n\n<br/><br/>\nSo again, wherever he might discover any one ready to distinguish\n\nhimself in the service of uprightness, his delight was to make this\n\nman richer than those who seek for gain by unfair means. On the same\n\nprinciple, his own administration was in all respects uprightly\n", "conducted, and, in particular, he secured the services of an army\n\nworthy of the name. Generals, and subalterns alike, came to him from\n\nacross the seas, not merely to make money, but because they saw that\n\nloyalty to Cyrus was a more profitable investment than so many pounds\n\na month. Let any man whatsoever render him willing service, such\n\nenthusiasm was sure to win its reward. And so Cyrus could always\n\ncommand the service of the best assistants, it was said, whatever the\n\nwork might be.\n\n<br/><br/>\nOr if he saw any skilful and just steward who furnished well the\n\ncountry over which he ruled, and created revenues, so far from robbing\n\nhim at any time, to him who had, he delighted to give more. So that\n\ntoil was a pleasure, and gains were amassed with confidence, and least\n\nof all from Cyrus would a man conceal the amount of his possessions,\n\nseeing that he showed no jealousy of wealth openly avowed, but his      19\n\nendeavour was rather to turn to account the riches of those who kept\n\nthem secret. Towards the friends he had made, whose kindliness he\n\nknew, or whose fitness as fellow-workers with himself, in aught which\n\nhe might wish to carry out, he had tested, he showed himself in turn\n\nan adept in the arts of courtesy. Just in proportion as he felt the\n\nneed of this friend or that to help him, so he tried to help each of\n\nthem in return in whatever seemed to be their heart's desire.\n\n<br/><br/>\nMany were the gifts bestowed on him, for many and diverse reasons; no\n\none man, perhaps, ever received more; no one, certainly, was ever more\n\nready to bestow them upon others, with an eye ever to the taste of\n\neach, so as to gratify what he saw to be the individual requirement.\n\nMany of these presents were sent to him to serve as personal\n\nadornments of the body or for battle; and as touching these he would\n\nsay, \"How am I to deck myself out in all these? to my mind a man's\n", "chief ornament is the adornment of nobly-adorned friends.\" Indeed,\n\nthat he should triumph over his friends in the great matters of\n\nwelldoing is not surprising, seeing that he was much more powerful\n\nthan they, but that he should go beyond them in minute attentions, and\n\nin an eager desire to give pleasure, seems to me, I must confess, more\n\nadmirable. Frequently when he had tasted some specially excellent\n\nwine, he would send the half remaining flagon to some friend with a\n\nmessage to say: \"Cyrus says, this is the best wine he has tasted for a\n\nlong time, that is his excuse for sending it to you. He hopes you will\n\ndrink it up to-day with a choice party of friends.\" Or, perhaps, he\n\nwould send the remainder of a dish of geese, half loaves of bread, and\n\nso forth, the bearer being instructed to say: \"This is Cyrus's\n\nfavourite dish, he hopes you will taste it yourself.\" Or, perhaps,\n\nthere was a great dearth of provender, when, through the number of his\n\nservants and his own careful forethought, he was enabled to get\n\nsupplies for himself; at such times he would send to his friends in\n\ndifferent parts, bidding them feed their horses on his hay, since it\n\nwould not do for the horses that carried his friends to go starving.\n\nThen, on any long march or expedition, where the crowd of lookers-on    28\n\nwould be large, he would call his friends to him and entertain them\n\nwith serious talk, as much as to say, \"These I delight to honour.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nSo that, for myself, and from all that I can hear, I should be\n\ndisposed to say that no one, Greek or barbarian, was ever so beloved.\n\nIn proof of this, I may cite the fact that, though Cyrus was the\n\nking's vassal and slave, no one ever forsook him to join his master,\n\nif I may except the attempt of Orontas, which was abortive. That man,\n\nindeed, had to learn that Cyrus was closer to the heart of him on\n\nwhose fidelity he relied than he himself was. On the other hand, many\n\na man revolted from the king to Cyrus, after they went to war with one\n", "another; nor were these nobodies, but rather persons high in the\n\nking's affection; yet for all that, they believed that their virtues\n\nwould obtain a reward more adequate from Cyrus than from the king.\n\nAnother great proof at once of his own worth and of his capacity\n\nrightly to discern all loyal, loving and firm friendship is afforded\n\nby an incident which belongs to the last moment of his life. He was\n\nslain, but fighting for his life beside him fell also every one of his\n\nfaithful bodyguard of friends and table-companions, with the sole\n\nexception of Ariaeus, who was in command of the cavalry on the left,\n\nand he no sooner perceived the fall of Cyrus than he betook himself to\n\nflight, with the whole body of troops under his lead.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nX\n\n<br/><br/>\nThen the head of Cyrus and his right hand were severed from the body.   1\n\nBut the king and those about him pursued and fell upon the Cyreian\n\ncamp, and the troops of Ariaeus no longer stood their ground, but fled\n\nthrough their own camp back to the halting-place of the night\n\nbefore--a distance of four parasangs, it was said. So the king and\n\nthose with him fell to ravaging right and left, and amongst other\n\nspoil he captured the Phocaean woman, who was a concubine of Cyrus,\n\nwitty and beautiful, if fame speaks correctly. The Milesian, who was\n\nthe younger, was also seized by some of the king's men; but, letting\n\ngo her outer garment, she made good her escape to the Hellenes, who\n\nhad been left among the camp followers on guard. These fell at once     3\n\ninto line and put to the sword many of the pillagers, though they lost\n\nsome men themselves; they stuck to the place and succeeded in saving\n", "not only that lady, but all else, whether chattels or human beings,\n\nwhich lay within their reach.\n\n<br/><br/>\nAt this point the king and the Hellenes were something like three\n\nmiles apart; the one set were pursuing their opponents just as if\n\ntheir conquest had been general; the others were pillaging as merrily\n\nas if their victory were already universal. But when the Hellenes\n\nlearnt that the king and his troops were in the baggage camp; and the\n\nking, on his side, was informed by Tissaphernes that the Hellenes were\n\nvictorious in their quarter of the field, and had gone forward in\n\npursuit, the effect was instantaneous. The king massed his troops and\n\nformed into line. Clearchus summoned Proxenus, who was next him, and\n\ndebated whether to send a detachment or to go in a body to the camp to\n\nsave it.\n\n<br/><br/>\nMeanwhile the king was seen again advancing, as it seemed, from the\n\nrear; and the Hellenes, turning right about, prepared to receive his\n\nattack then and there. But instead of advancing upon them at that\n\npoint, he drew off, following the line by which he had passed earlier\n\nin the day, outside the left wing of his opponent, and so picked up in\n\nhis passage those who had deserted to the Hellenes during the battle,\n\nas also Tissaphernes and his division. The latter had not fled in the\n\nfirst shock of the encounter; he had charged parallel to the line of\n\nthe Euphrates into the Greek peltasts, and through them. But charge as\n\nhe might, he did not lay low a single man. On the contrary, the\n\nHellenes made a gap to let them through, hacking them with their\n\nswords and hurling their javelins as they passed. Episthenes of\n\nAmphipolis was in command of the peltasts, and he showed himself a\n\nsensible man, it was said. Thus it was that Tissaphernes, having got\n\nthrough haphazard, with rather the worst of it, failed to wheel round\n", "and return the way he came, but reaching the camp of the Hellenes,      8\n\nthere fell in with the king; and falling into order again, the two\n\ndivisions advanced side by side.\n\n<br/><br/>\nWhen they were parallel with the (original) left wing of the Hellenes,\n\nfear seized the latter lest they might take them in flank and enfold\n\nthem on both sides and cut them down. In this apprehension they\n\ndetermined to extend their line and place the river on their rear. But\n\nwhile they deliberated, the king passed by and ranged his troops in\n\nline to meet them, in exactly the same position in which he had\n\nadvanced to offer battle at the commencement of the engagement. The\n\nHellenes, now seeing them in close proximity and in battle order, once\n\nagain raised the paean and began the attack with still greater\n\nenthusiasm than before: and once again the barbarians did not wait to\n\nreceive them, but took to flight, even at a greater distance than\n\nbefore. The Hellenes pressed the pursuit until they reached a certain\n\nvillage, where they halted, for above the village rose a mound, on\n\nwhich the king and his party rallied and reformed; they had no\n\ninfantry any longer, but the crest was crowded with cavalry, so that\n\nit was impossible to discover what was happening. They did see, they\n\nsaid, the royal standard, a kind of golden eagle, with wings extended,\n\nperched on a bar of wood and raised upon a lance.\n\n<br/><br/>\nBut as soon as the Hellenes again moved onwards, the hostile cavalry\n\nat once left the hillock--not in a body any longer, but in\n\nfragments--some streaming from one side, some from another; and the\n\ncrest was gradually stripped of its occupants, till at last the\n\ncompany was gone. Accordingly, Clearchus did not ascend the crest, but\n\nposting his army at its base, he sent Lycius of Syracuse and another\n\nto the summit, with orders to inspect the condition of things on the\n", "other side, and to report results. Lycius galloped up and\n\ninvestigated, bringing back news that they were fleeing might and\n\nmain. Almost at that instant the sun sank beneath the horizon. There\n\nthe Hellenes halted; they grounded arms and rested, marvelling the\n\nwhile that Cyrus was not anywhere to be seen, and that no messenger\n\nhad come from him. For they were in complete ignorance of his death,\n\nand conjectured that either he had gone off in pursuit, or had pushed\n\nforward to occupy some point. Left to themselves, they now\n\ndeliberated, whether they should stay where they were and have the\n\nbaggage train brought up, or should return to camp. They resolved to\n\nreturn, and about supper time reached the tents. Such was the\n\nconclusion of this day.\n\n<br/><br/>\nThey found the larger portion of their property pillaged, eatables and\n\ndrinkables alike, not excepting the wagons laden with corn and wine,\n\nwhich Cyrus had prepared in case of some extreme need overtaking the\n\nexpedition, to divide among the Hellenes. There were four hundred of\n\nthese wagons, it was said, and these had now been ransacked by the\n\nking and his men; so that the greater number of the Hellenes went\n\nsupperless, having already gone without their breakfasts, since the\n\nking had appeared before the usual halt for breakfast. Accordingly, in\n\nno better plight than this they passed the night.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nBOOK II\n\n<br/><br/>\n     (In the previous book will be found a full account of the\n\n     method by which Cyrus collected a body of Greeks when\n", "     meditating an expedition against his brother Artaxerxes; as\n\n     also of various occurrences on the march up; of the battle\n\n     itself, and of the death of Cyrus; and lastly, a description\n\n     of the arrival of the Hellenes in camp after the battle, and\n\n     as to how they betook themselves to rest, none suspecting\n\n     but what they were altogether victorious and that Cyrus\n\n     lived.)\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nI\n\n<br/><br/>\nWith the break of day the generals met, and were surprised that Cyrus   1\n\nshould not have appeared himself, or at any rate have sent some one to\n\ntell them what to do. Accordingly, they resolved to put what they had\n\ntogether, to get under arms, and to push forward until they effected\n\njunction with Cyrus. Just as they were on the point of starting, with\n\nthe rising sun came Procles the ruler of Teuthrania. He was a\n\ndescendant of Damaratus (1) the Laconian, and with him also came Glus\n\nthe son of Tamos. These two told them, first, that Cyrus was dead;\n\nnext, that Ariaeus had retreated with the rest of the barbarians to\n\nthe halting-place whence they had started at dawn on the previous day;\n\nand wished to inform them that, if they were minded to come, he would\n\nwait for this one day, but on the morrow he should return home again\n\nto Ionia, whence he came.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) The Spartan king who was deposed in B.C. 491, whereupon he fled to\n\n    King Darius, and settled in south-western Mysia. See Herod. vi.\n\n    50, 61-70. We shall hear more of his descendant, Procles, the\n", "    ruler of Teuthrania, in the last chapter of this work.\n\n<br/><br/>\nWhen they heard these tidings, the generals were sorely distressed; so  4\n\ntoo were the rest of the Hellenes when they were informed of it. Then\n\nClearchus spoke as follows: \"Would that Cyrus were yet alive! But\n\nsince he is dead, take back this answer to Ariaeus, that we, at any\n\nrate, have conquered the king; and, as you yourselves may see, there\n\nis not a man left in the field to meet us. Indeed, had you not\n\narrived, we should ere this have begun our march upon the king. Now,\n\nwe can promise to Ariaeus that, if he will join us here, we will place\n\nhim on the king's throne. Surely to those who conquer empire\n\npertains.\" With these words he sent back the messengers and with them\n\nhe sent Cheirisophus the Laconian, and Menon the Thessalian. That was\n\nwhat Menon himself wished, being, as he was, a friend and intimate of\n\nAriaeus, and bound by mutual ties of hospitality. So these set off,\n\nand Clearchus waited for them.\n\n<br/><br/>\nThe soldiers furnished themselves with food  (and drink) as best they\n\nmight--falling back on the baggage animals, and cutting up oxen and\n\nasses. There was no lack of firewood; they need only step forward a\n\nfew paces from the line where the battle was fought, and they would\n\nfind arrows to hand in abundance, which the Hellenes had forced the\n\ndeserters from the king to throw away. There were arrows and wicker\n\nshields also, and the huge wooden shields of the Egyptians. There were\n\nmany targets also, and empty wagons left to be carried off. Here was a\n\nstore which they were not slow to make use of to cook their meat and\n\nserve their meals that day.\n\n<br/><br/>\nIt was now about full market hour (2) when heralds from the king and\n\nTissaphernes arrived. These were barbarians with one exception. This\n", "was a certain Phalinus, a Hellene who lived at the court of\n\nTissaphernes, and was held in high esteem. He gave himself out to be a\n\nconnoisseur of tactics and the art of fighting with heavy arms. These\n\nwere the men who now came up, and having summoned the generals of the\n\nHellenes, they delivered themselves of the following message: \"The\n\ngreat king having won the victory and slain Cyrus, bids the Hellenes\n\nto surrender their arms; to betake themselves to the gates of the\n\nking's palace, and there obtain for themselves what terms they can.\"\n\nThat was what the heralds said, and the Hellenes listened with heavy    9\n\nhearts; but Clearchus spoke, and his words were few; \"Conquerors do\n\nnot, as a rule, give up their arms\"; then turning to the others he\n\nadded, \"I leave it to you, my fellow-generals, to make the best and\n\nnoblest answer, that ye may, to these gentlemen. I will rejoin you\n\npresently.\" At the moment an official had summoned him to come and\n\nlook at the entrails which had been taken out, for, as it chanced, he\n\nwas engaged in sacrificing. As soon as he was gone, Cleanor the\n\nArcadian, by right of seniority, answered: \"They would sooner die than\n\ngive up their arms.\" Then Proxenus the Theban said: \"For my part, I\n\nmarvel if the king demands our arms as our master, or for the sake of\n\nfriendship merely, as presents. If as our master, why need he ask for\n\nthem rather than come and take them? But if he would fain wheedle us\n\nout of them by fine speeches, he should tell us what the soldiers will\n\nreceive in turn for such kindness.\" In answer to him Phalinus said:\n\n\"The king claims to have conquered, because he has put Cyrus to death;\n\nand who is there now to claim the kingdom as against himself? He\n\nfurther flatters himself that you also are in his power, since he\n\nholds you in the heart of his country, hemmed in by impassable rivers;\n\nand he can at any moment bring against you a multitude so vast that\n\neven if leave were given to rise and slay you could not kill them.\"\n\nAfter him Theopompus (3) the Athenian spoke. \"Phalinus,\" he said, \"at\n", "this instant, as you yourself can see, we have nothing left but our\n\narms and our valour. If we keep the former we imagine we can make use\n\nof the latter; but if we deliver up our arms we shall presently be\n\nrobbed of our lives. Do not suppose then that we are going to give up\n\nto you the only good things which we possess. We prefer to keep them;\n\nand by their help we will do battle with you for the good things which\n\nare yours.\" Phalinus laughed when he heard those words, and said:       13\n\n\"Spoken like a philosopher, my fine young man, and very pretty\n\nreasoning too; yet, let me tell you, your wits are somewhat scattered\n\nif you imagine that your valour will get the better of the king's\n\npower.\" There were one or two others, it was said, who with a touch of\n\nweakness in their tone or argument, made answer: \"They had proved good\n\nand trusty friends to Cyrus, and the king might find them no less\n\nvaluable. If he liked to be friends with them, he might turn them to\n\nany use that pleased his fancy, say for a campaign against Egypt.\n\nTheir arms were at his service; they would help to lay that country at\n\nhis feet.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\n (2) 10 A.M.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (3) So the best MSS. Others read \"Xenophon,\" which Kruger maintains to\n\n    be the true reading. He suggests that \"Theopompus\" may have crept\n\n    into the text from a marginal note of a scholiast, \"Theopompus\"\n\n    (the historian) \"gives the remark to Proxenus.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nJust then Clearchus returned, and wished to know what answer they had\n\ngiven. The words were barely out of his mouth before Phalinus\n\ninterrupting, answered: \"As for your friends here, one says one thing\n\nand one another; will you please give us your opinion\"; and he\n\nreplied: \"The sight of you, Phalinus, caused me much pleasure; and not\n", "only me, but all of us, I feel sure; for you are a Hellene even as we\n\nare--every one of us whom you see before you. In our present plight we\n\nwould like to take you into our counsel as to what we had better do\n\ntouching your proposals. I beg you then solemnly, in the sight of\n\nheaven--do you tender us such advice as you shall deem best and\n\nworthiest, and such as shall bring you honour of after time, when it\n\nwill be said of you how once on a time Phalinus was sent by the great\n\nking to bid certain Hellenes yield up their arms, and when they had\n\ntaken him into their counsel, he gave them such and such advice. You\n\nknow that whatever advice you do give us cannot fail to be reported in\n\nHellas.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nClearchus threw out these leading remarks in hopes that this man, who\n\nwas the ambassador from the king, might himself be led to advise them\n\nnot to give up their arms, in which case the Hellenes would be still\n\nmore sanguine and hopeful. But, contrary to his expectation, Phalinus\n\nturned round and said: \"I say that if you have one chance, one hope in\n\nten thousand to wage a war with the king successfully, do not give up\n\nyour arms. That is my advice. If, however, you have no chance of\n\nescape without the king's consent, then I say save yourselves in the\n\nonly way you can.\" And Clearchus answered: \"So, then, that is your      20\n\ndeliberate view? Well, this is our answer, take it back. We conceive\n\nthat in either case, whether we are expected to be friends with the\n\nking, we shall be worth more as friends if we keep our arms than if we\n\nyield them to another; or whether we are to go to war, we shall fight\n\nbetter with them than without.\" And Phalinus said: \"That answer we\n\nwill repeat; but the king bade me tell you this besides, 'Whilst you\n\nremain here there is truce; but one step forward or one step back, the\n\ntruce ends; there is war.' Will you then please inform us as to that\n\npoint also? Are you minded to stop and keep truce, or is there to be\n", "war? What answer shall I take from you?\" And Clearchus replied: \"Pray\n\nanswer that we hold precisely the same views on this point as the\n\nking.\"--\"How say you the same views?\" asked Phalinus. Clearchus made\n\nanswer: \"As long as we stay here there is truce, but a step forward or\n\na step backward, the truce ends; there is war.\" The other again asked:\n\n\"Peace or war, what answer shall I make?\" Clearchus returned answer\n\nonce again in the same words: \"Truce if we stop, but if we move\n\nforwards or backwards war.\" But what he was minded really to do, that\n\nhe refused to make further manifest.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nII\n\n<br/><br/>\nPhalinus and those that were with him turned and went. But the          1\n\nmessengers from Ariaeus, Procles and Cheirisophus came back. As to\n\nMenon, he stayed behind with Ariaeus, They brought back this answer\n\nfrom Ariaeus: \"'There are many Persians,' he says, 'better than\n\nhimself who will not suffer him to sit upon the king's throne; but if\n\nyou are minded to go back with him, you must join him this very night,\n\notherwise he will set off himself to-morrow on the homeward route.'\"\n\nAnd Clearchus said: \"It had best stand thus between us then. If we\n\ncome, well and good, be it as you propose; but if we do not come, do\n\nwhatsoever you think most conducive to your interests.\" And so he kept\n\nthese also in the dark as to his real intention.\n\n<br/><br/>\nAfter this, when the sun was already sinking, he summoned the generals\n\nand officers, and made the following statement: \"Sirs, I sacrificed\n\nand found the victims unfavourable to an advance against the king.\n", "After all, it is not so surprising perhaps, for, as I now learn,\n\nbetween us and the king flows the river Tigris, navigable for big       3\n\nvessels, and we could not possibly cross it without boats, and boats\n\nwe have none. On the other hand, to stop here is out of the question,\n\nfor there is no possibility of getting provisions. However, the\n\nvictims were quite agreeable to us joining the friends of Cyrus. This\n\nis what we must do then. Let each go away and sup on whatever he has.\n\nAt the first sound of the bugle to turn in, get kit and baggage\n\ntogether; at the second signal, place them on the baggage animals; and\n\nat the third, fall in and follow the lead, with the baggage animals on\n\nthe inside protected by the river, and the troops outside.\" After\n\nhearing the orders, the generals and officers retired, and did as they\n\nwere bid; and for the future Clearchus led, and the rest followed in\n\nobedience to his orders, not that they had expressly chosen him, but\n\nthey saw that he alone had the sense and wisdom requisite in a\n\ngeneral, while the rest were inexperienced (1).\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) The MSS. add the words, \"The total distance of the route, taking\n\n    Ephesus in Ionia as the starting point up to the field of battle,\n\n    consisted of 93 stages, 535 parasangs, or 16,050 furlongs; from\n\n    the battle-field to Babylon (reckoned a three days' journey) would\n\n    have been another 360 stades,\" which may well be an editor's or\n\n    commentator's marginal note.\n\n<br/><br/>\nHere, under cover of the darkness which descended, the Thracian\n\nMiltocythes, with forty horsemen and three hundred Thracian infantry,\n\ndeserted to the king; but the rest of the troops--Clearchus leading\n\nand the rest following in accordance with the orders promulgated--took\n\ntheir departure, and about midnight reached their first stage, having\n\ncome up with Ariaeus and his army. They grounded arms just as they\n", "stood in rank, and the generals and officers of the Hellenes met in\n\nthe tent of Ariaeus. There they exchanged oaths--the Hellenes on the\n\none side and Ariaeus with his principal officers on the other--not to\n\nbetray one another, but to be true to each other as allies. The\n\nAsiatics further solemnly pledged themselves by oath to lead the way\n\nwithout treachery. The oaths were ratified by the sacrifice of a bull,\n\na wolf (2), a boar, and a ram over a shield. The Hellenes dipped a\n\nsword, the barbarians a lance, into the blood of the victims.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (2) It is a question whether the words \"a wolf\" ought not to be\n\n    omitted.\n\n<br/><br/>\nAs soon as the pledge was taken, Clearchus spoke: \"And now, Ariaeus,\"\n\nhe said, \"since you and we have one expedition in prospect, will you    10\n\ntell us what you think about the route; shall we return the way we\n\ncame, or have you devised a better?\" He answered: \"To return the same\n\nway is to perish to a man by hunger; for at this moment we have no\n\nprovisions whatsoever. During the seventeen last stages, even on our\n\nway hither, we could extract nothing from the country; or, if there\n\nwas now and again anything, we passed over and utterly consumed it. At\n\nthis time our project is to take another and a longer journey\n\ncertainly, but we shall not be in straits for provisions. The earliest\n\nstages must be very long, as long as we can make them; the object is\n\nto put as large a space as possible between us and the royal army;\n\nonce we are two or three days' journey off, the danger is over. The\n\nking will never overtake us. With a small army he will not dare to dog\n\nour heels, and with a vast equipment he will lack the power to march\n\nquickly. Perhaps he, too, may even find a scarcity of provisions.\n\nThere,\" said he, \"you asked for my opinion, see, I have given it.\"\n\n<br/><br/>", "Here was a plan of the campaign, which was equivalent to a stampede:\n\nhelter-skelter they were to run away, or get into hiding somehow; but\n\nfortune proved a better general. For as soon as it was day they\n\nrecommenced the journey, keeping the sun on their right, and\n\ncalculating that with the westering rays they would have reached\n\nvillages in the territory of Babylonia, and in this hope they were not\n\ndeceived. While it was yet afternoon, they thought they caught sight\n\nof some of the enemy's cavalry; and those of the Hellenes who were not\n\nin rank ran to their ranks; and Ariaeus, who was riding in a wagon to\n\nnurse a wound, got down and donned his cuirass, the rest of his party\n\nfollowing his example. Whilst they were arming themselves, the scouts,\n\nwho had been sent forward, came back with the information that they\n\nwere not cavalry but baggage animals grazing. It was at once clear to\n\nall that they must be somewhere in the neighbourhood of the king's\n\nencampment. Smoke could actually be seen rising, evidently from\n\nvillages not far ahead. Clearchus hesitated to advance upon the enemy,\n\nknowing that the troops were tired and hungry; and indeed it was\n\nalready late. On the other hand he had no mind either to swerve from\n\nhis route--guarding against any appearance of flight. Accordingly he    16\n\nmarched straight as an arrow, and with sunset entered the nearest\n\nvillages with his vanguard and took up quarters.\n\n<br/><br/>\nThese villages had been thoroughly sacked and dismantled by the royal\n\narmy--down to the very woodwork and furniture of the houses. Still,\n\nthe vanguard contrived to take up their quarters in some sort of\n\nfashion; but the rear division, coming up in the dark, had to bivouac\n\nas best they could, one detachment after another; and a great noise\n\nthey made, with hue and cry to one another, so that the enemy could\n\nhear them; and those in their immediate proximity actually took to\n\ntheir heels, left their quarters, and decamped, as was plain enough\n", "next morning, when not a beast was to be seen, nor sign of camp or\n\nwreath of smoke anywhere in the neighbourhood. The king, as it would\n\nappear, was himself quite taken aback by the advent of the army; as he\n\nfully showed by his proceedings next day.\n\n<br/><br/>\nDuring the progress of this night the Hellenes had their turn of\n\nscare--a panic seized them, and there was a noise and clatter, hardly\n\nto be explained except by the visitation of some sudden terror. But\n\nClearchus had with him the Eleian Tolmides, the best herald of his\n\ntime; him he ordered to proclaim silence, and then to give out this\n\nproclamation of the generals: \"Whoever will give any information as to\n\nwho let an ass into the camp shall receive a talent of silver in\n\nreward.\" On hearing this proclamation the soldiers made up their minds\n\nthat their fear was baseless, and their generals safe and sound. At\n\nbreak of day Clearchus gave the order to the Hellenes to get under\n\narms in line of battle, and take up exactly the same position as they\n\nheld on the day of the battle.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nIII\n\n<br/><br/>\nAnd now comes the proof of what I stated above--that the king was       1\n\nutterly taken aback by the sudden apparition of the army; only the day\n\nbefore, he had sent and demanded the surrender of their arms--and now,\n\nwith the rising sun, came heralds sent by him to arrange a truce.\n\nThese, having reached the advanced guard, asked for the generals. The\n\nguard reported their arrival; and Clearchus, who was busy inspecting\n\nthe ranks, sent back word to the heralds that they must await his\n", "leisure. Having carefully arranged the troops so that from every side\n\nthey might present the appearance of a compact battle line without a    3\n\nsingle unarmed man in sight, he summoned the ambassadors, and himself\n\nwent forward to meet them with the soldiers, who for choice\n\naccoutrement and noble aspect were the flower of his force; a course\n\nwhich he had invited the other generals also to adopt.\n\n<br/><br/>\nAnd now, being face to face with the ambassadors, he questioned them\n\nas to what their wishes were. They replied that they had come to\n\narrange a truce, and were persons competent to carry proposals from\n\nthe king to the Hellenes and from the Hellenes to the king. He\n\nreturned answer to them: \"Take back word then to your master, that we\n\nneed a battle first, for we have had no breakfast; and he will be a\n\nbrave man who will dare mention the word 'truce' to Hellenes without\n\nproviding them with breakfast.\" With this message the heralds rode\n\noff, but were back again in no time, which was a proof that the king,\n\nor some one appointed by him to transact the business, was hard by.\n\nThey reported that \"the message seemed reasonable to the king; they\n\nhad now come bringing guides who, if a truce were arranged, would\n\nconduct them where they would get provisions.\" Clearchus inquired\n\n\"whether the truce was offered to the individual men merely as they\n\nwent and came, or to all alike.\" \"To all,\" they replied, \"until the\n\nking receives your final answer.\" When they had so spoken, Clearchus,\n\nhaving removed the ambassadors, held a council; and it was resolved to\n\nmake a truce at once, and then quietly to go and secure provisions;\n\nand Clearchus said: \"I agree to the resolution; still I do not propose\n\nto announce it at once, but to wile away time till the ambassadors\n\nbegin to fear that we have decided against the truce; though I\n\nsuspect,\" he added, \"the same fear will be operative on the minds of\n\nour soldiers also.\" As soon as the right moment seemed to have\n", "arrived, he delivered his answer in favour of the truce, and bade the\n\nambassadors at once conduct them to the provisions.\n\n<br/><br/>\nSo these led the way; and Clearchus, without relaxing precaution, in\n\nspite of having secured a truce, marched after them with his army in\n\nline and himself in command of the rearguard. Over and over again they\n\nencountered trenches and conduits so full of water that they could not  10\n\nbe crossed without bridges; but they contrived well enough for these\n\nby means of trunks of palm trees which had fallen, or which they cut\n\ndown for the occasion. And here Clearchus's system of superintendence\n\nwas a study in itself; as he stood with a spear in his left hand and a\n\nstick in the other; and when it seemed to him there was any dawdling\n\namong the parties told off to the work, he would pick out the right\n\nman and down would come the stick; nor, at the same time, was he above\n\nplunging into the mud and lending a hand himself, so that every one\n\nelse was forced for very shame to display equal alacrity. The men told\n\noff for the business were the men of thirty years of age; but even the\n\nelder men, when they saw the energy of Clearchus, could not resist\n\nlending their aid also. What stimulated the haste of Clearchus was the\n\nsuspicion in his mind that these trenches were not, as a rule, so full\n\nof water, since it was not the season to irrigate the plain; and he\n\nfancied that the king had let the water on for the express purpose of\n\nvividly presenting to the Hellenes the many dangers with which their\n\nmarch was threatened at the very start.\n\n<br/><br/>\nProceeding on their way they reached some villages, where their guides\n\nindicated to them that they would find provisions. They were found to\n\ncontain plenty of corn, and wine made from palm dates, and an\n\nacidulated beverage extracted by boiling from the same fruit. As to\n\nthe palm nuts or dates themselves, it was noticeable that the sort\n", "which we are accustomed to see in Hellas were set aside for the\n\ndomestic servants; those put aside for the masters are picked\n\nspecimens, and are simply marvellous for their beauty and size,\n\nlooking like great golden lumps of amber; some specimens they dried\n\nand preserved as sweetmeats. Sweet enough they were as an\n\naccompaniment of wine, but apt to give headache. Here, too, for the\n\nfirst time in their lives, the men tasted the brain (1) of the palm. No\n\none could help being struck by the beauty of this object, and the\n\npeculiarity of its delicious flavour; but this, like the dried fruits,\n\nwas exceedingly apt to give headache. When this cabbage or brain has\n\nbeen removed from the palm the whole tree withers from top to bottom.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) I.e. the cabbage-like crown.\n\n<br/><br/>\nIn these villages they remained three days, and a deputation from the   17\n\ngreat king arrived--Tissaphernes and the king's brother-in-law and\n\nthree other Persians--with a retinue of many slaves. As soon as the\n\ngenerals of the Hellenes had presented themselves, Tissaphernes opened\n\nthe proceedings with the following speech, through the lips of an\n\ninterpreter: \"Men of Hellas, I am your next-door neighbour in Hellas.\n\nTherefore was it that I, when I saw into what a sea of troubles you\n\nwere fallen, regarded it as a godsend, if by any means I might obtain,\n\nas a boon from the king, the privilege of bringing you back in safety\n\nto your own country: and that, I take it, will earn me gratitude from\n\nyou and all Hellas. In this determination I preferred my request to\n\nthe king; I claimed it as a favour which was fairly my due; for was it\n\nnot I who first announced to him the hostile approach of Cyrus? who\n\nsupported that announcement by the aid I brought; who alone among the\n\nofficers confronted with the Hellenes in battle did not flee, but\n\ncharged right through and united my troops with the king inside your\n", "camp, where he was arrived, having slain Cyrus; it was I, lastly, who\n\ngave chase to the barbarians under Cyrus, with the help of those here\n\npresent with me at this moment, which are also among the trustiest\n\nfollowers of our lord the king. Now, I counsel you to give a moderate\n\nanswer, so that it may be easier for me to carry out my design, if\n\nhaply I may obtain from him some good thing on your behalf.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nThereupon the Hellenes retired and took counsel. Then they answered,\n\nand Clearchus was their spokesman: \"We neither mustered as a body to\n\nmake war against the king, nor was our march conducted with that\n\nobject. But it was Cyrus, as you know, who invented many and divers\n\npretexts, that he might take you off your guard, and transport us\n\nhither. Yet, after a while, when we saw that he was in sore straits,\n\nwe were ashamed in the sight of God and man to betray him, whom we had\n\npermitted for so long a season to benefit us. But now that Cyrus is\n\ndead, we set up no claim to his kingdom against the king himself;\n\nthere is neither person nor thing for the sake of which we would care   23\n\nto injure the king's country; we would not choose to kill him if we\n\ncould, rather we would march straight home, if we were not molested;\n\nbut, God helping us, we will retaliate on all who injure us. On the\n\nother hand, if any be found to benefit us, we do not mean to be\n\noutdone in kindly deeds, as far as in us lies.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nSo he spoke, and Tissaphernes listened and replied: \"That answer will\n\nI take back to the king and bring you word from him again. Until I\n\ncome again, let the truce continue, and we will furnish you with a\n\nmarket.\" All next day he did not come back, and the Hellenes were\n\ntroubled with anxieties, but on the third day he arrived with the news\n\nthat he had obtained from the king the boon he asked; he was permitted\n\nto save the Hellenes, though there were many gainsayers who argued\n", "that it was not seemly for the king to let those who had marched\n\nagainst him depart in peace. And at last he said: \"You may now, if you\n\nlike, take pledges from us, that we will make the countries through\n\nwhich you pass friendly to you, and will lead you back without\n\ntreachery into Hellas, and will furnish you with a market; and\n\nwherever you cannot purchase, we will permit you to take provisions\n\nfrom the district. You, on your side, must swear that you will march\n\nas through a friendly country, without damage--merely taking food and\n\ndrink wherever we fail to supply a market--or, if we afford a market,\n\nyou shall only obtain provisions by paying for them.\" This was agreed\n\nto, and oaths and pledges exchanged between them--Tissaphernes and the\n\nking's brother-in-law upon the one side, and the generals and officers\n\nof the Hellenes on the other. After this Tissaphernes said: \"And now I\n\ngo back to the king; as soon as I have transacted what I have a mind\n\nto, I will come back, ready equipped, to lead you away to Hellas, and\n\nto return myself to my own dominion.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nIV\n\n<br/><br/>\nAfter these things the Hellenes and Ariaeus waited for Tissaphernes,    1\n\nbeing encamped close to one another: for more than twenty days they\n\nwaited, during which time there came visitors to Ariaeus, his brother\n\nand other kinsfolk. To those under him came certain other Persians,\n\nencouraging them and bearing pledges to some of them from the king\n\nhimself--that he would bear no grudge against them on account of the\n\npart they bore in the expedition against him with Cyrus, or for aught\n\nelse of the things which were past. Whilst these overtures were being\n", "made, Ariaeus and his friends gave manifest signs of paying less\n\nattention to the Hellenes, so much so that, if for no other reason,\n\nthe majority of the latter were not well pleased, and they came to\n\nClearchus and the other generals, asking what they were waiting for.\n\n\"Do we not know full well,\" they said, \"that the king would give a\n\ngreat deal to destroy us, so that other Hellenes may take warning and\n\nthink twice before they march against the king. To-day it suits his\n\npurpose to induce us to stop here, because his army is scattered; but\n\nas soon as he has got together another armament, attack us most\n\ncertainly he will. How do we know he is not at this moment digging\n\naway at trenches, or running up walls, to make our path impassable. It\n\nis not to be supposed that he will desire us to return to Hellas with\n\na tale how a handful of men like ourselves beat the king at his own\n\ngates, laughed him to scorn, and then came home again.\" Clearchus\n\nreplied: \"I too am keenly aware of all this; but I reason thus: if we\n\nturn our backs now, they will say, we mean war and are acting contrary\n\nto the truce, and then what follows? First of all, no one will furnish\n\nus with a market or means of providing ourselves with food. Next, we\n\nshall have no one to guide us; moreover, such action on our part will\n\nbe a signal to Ariaeus to hold aloof from us, so that not a friend\n\nwill be left to us; even those who were formerly our friends will now\n\nbe numbered with our enemies. What other river, or rivers, we may find\n\nwe have to cross, I do not know; but this we know, to cross the\n\nEuphrates in face of resistance is impossible. You see, in the event\n\nof being driven to an engagement, we have no cavalry to help us, but\n\nwith the enemy it is the reverse--not only the most, but the best of\n\nhis troops are cavalry, so that if we are victorious, we shall kill no\n\none, but if we are defeated, not a man of us can escape. For my part,\n\nI cannot see why the king, who has so many advantages on his side, if   7\n\nhe desires to destroy us, should swear oaths and tender solemn pledges\n", "merely in order to perjure himself in the sight of heaven, to render\n\nhis word worthless and his credit discreditable the wide world over.\"\n\nThese arguments he propounded at length.\n\n<br/><br/>\nMeanwhile Tissaphernes came back, apparently ready to return home; he\n\nhad his own force with him, and so had Orontas, who was also present,\n\nhis. The latter brought, moreover, his bride with him, the king's\n\ndaughter, whom he had just wedded. The journey was now at length\n\nfairly commenced. Tissaphernes led the way, and provided a market.\n\nThey advanced, and Ariaeus advanced too, at the head of Cyrus's\n\nAsiatic troops, side by side with Tissaphernes and Orontas, and with\n\nthese two he also pitched his camp. The Hellenes, holding them in\n\nsuspicion, marched separately with the guides, and they encamped on\n\neach occasion a parasang apart, or rather less; and both parties kept\n\nwatch upon each other as if they were enemies, which hardly tended to\n\nlull suspicion; and sometimes, whilst foraging for wood and grass and\n\nso forth on the same ground, blows were exchanged, which occasioned\n\nfurther embitterments. Three stages they had accomplished ere they\n\nreached the wall of Media, as it is called, and passed within it. It\n\nwas built of baked bricks laid upon bitumen. It was twenty feet broad\n\nand a hundred feet high, and the length of it was said to be twenty\n\nparasangs. It lies at no great distance from Babylon.\n\n<br/><br/>\nFrom this point they marched two stages--eight parasangs--and crossed\n\ntwo canals, the first by a regular bridge, the other spanned by a\n\nbridge of seven boats. These canals issued from the Tigris, and from\n\nthem a whole system of minor trenches was cut, leading over the\n\ncountry, large ones to begin with, and then smaller and smaller, till\n\nat last they become the merest runnels, like those in Hellas used for\n\nwatering millet fields. They reached the river Tigris. At this point\n", "there was a large and thickly populated city named Sittace, at a        13\n\ndistance of fifteen furlongs from the river. The Hellenes accordingly\n\nencamped by the side of that city, near a large and beautiful park,\n\nwhich was thick with all sorts of trees.\n\n<br/><br/>\nThe Asiatics had crossed the Tigris, but somehow were entirely hidden\n\nfrom view. After supper, Proxenus and Xenophon were walking in front\n\nof the place d'armes, when a man came up and demanded of the advanced\n\nguard where he could find Proxenus or Clearchus. He did not ask for\n\nMenon, and that too though he came from Ariaeus, who was Menon's\n\nfriend. As soon as Proxenus had said: \"I am he, whom you seek,\" the\n\nman replied: \"I have been sent by Ariaeus and Artaozus, who have been\n\ntrusty friends to Cyrus in past days, and are your well-wishers. They\n\nwarn you to be on your guard, in case the barbarians attack you in the\n\nnight. There is a large body of troops in the neighbouring park. They\n\nalso warn you to send and occupy the bridge over the Tigris, since\n\nTissaphernes is minded to break it down in the night, if he can, so\n\nthat you may not cross, but be caught between the river and the\n\ncanal.\" On hearing this they took the man to Clearchus and acquainted\n\nhim with his statement. Clearchus, on his side, was much disturbed,\n\nand indeed alarmed at the news. But a young fellow who was present (1),\n\nstruck with an idea, suggested that the two statements were\n\ninconsistent; as to the contemplated attack and the proposed\n\ndestruction of the bridge. Clearly, the attacking party must either\n\nconquer or be worsted: if they conquer, what need of their breaking\n\ndown the bridge? \"Why! if there were half a dozen bridges,\" said he,\n\n\"we should not be any the more able to save ourselves by flight--there\n\nwould be no place to flee to; but, in the opposite case, suppose we\n\nwin, with the bridge broken down, it is they who will not be able to\n\nsave themselves by flight; and, what is worse for them, not a single\n", "soul will be able to bring them succour from the other side, for all\n\ntheir numbers, since the bridge will be broken down.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) Possibly Xenophon himself.\n\n<br/><br/>\nClearchus listened to the reasoning, and then he asked the messenger,\n\n\"How large the country between the Tigris and the canal might be?\" \"A   21\n\nlarge district,\" he replied, \"and in it are villages and cities\n\nnumerous and large.\" Then it dawned upon them: the barbarians had sent\n\nthe man with subtlety, in fear lest the Hellenes should cut the bridge\n\nand occupy the island territory, with the strong defences of the\n\nTigris on the one side and of the canal on the other; supplying\n\nthemselves with provisions from the country so included, large and\n\nrich as it was, with no lack of hands to till it; in addition to\n\nwhich, a harbour of refuge and asylum would be found for any one, who\n\nwas minded to do the king a mischief.\n\n<br/><br/>\nAfter this they retired to rest in peace, not, however, neglecting to\n\nsend a guard to occupy the bridge in spite of all, and there was no\n\nattack from any quarter whatsoever; nor did any of the enemy's people\n\napproach the bridges: so the guards were able to report next morning.\n\nBut as soon as it was morning, they proceeded to cross the bridge,\n\nwhich consisted of thirty-seven vessels, and in so doing they used the\n\nutmost precaution possible; for reports were brought by some of the\n\nHellenes with Tissaphernes that an attempt was to be made to attack\n\nthem while crossing. All this turned out to be false, though it is\n\ntrue that while crossing they did catch sight of Glus watching, with\n\nsome others, to see if they crossed the river; but as soon as he had\n\nsatisfied himself on that point, he rode off and was gone.\n\n<br/><br/>", "From the river Tigris they advanced four stages--twenty parasangs--to\n\nthe river Physcus, which is a hundred feet broad and spanned by a\n\nbridge. Here lay a large and populous city named Opis, close to which\n\nthe Hellenes were encountered by the natural brother of Cyrus and\n\nArtaxerxes, who was leading a large army from Susa and Ecbatana to\n\nassist the king. He halted his troops and watched the Helleens march\n\npast. Clearchus led them in column two abreast: and from time to time\n\nthe vanguard came to a standstill, just so often and just so long the\n\neffect repeated itself down to the hindmost man: halt! halt! halt!\n\nalong the whole line: so that even to the Hellenes themselves their\n\narmy seemed enormous; and the Persian was fairly astonished at the\n\nspectacle.\n\n<br/><br/>\nFrom this place they marched through Media six desert stages--thirty    27\n\nparasangs--to the villages of Parysatis, Cyrus's and the king's\n\nmother. These Tissaphernes, in mockery of Cyrus, delivered over to the\n\nHellenes to plunder, except that the folk in them were not to be made\n\nslaves. They contained much corn, cattle, and other property. From\n\nthis place they advanced four desert stages--twenty parasangs--keeping\n\nthe Tigris on the left. On the first of these stages, on the other\n\nside of the river, lay a large city; it was a well-to-do place named\n\nCaenae, from which the natives used to carry across loaves and cheeses\n\nand wine on rafts made of skins.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nV\n\n<br/><br/>\nAfter this they reached the river Zapatas (1), which is four hundred     1\n", "feet broad, and here they halted three days. During the interval\n\nsuspicions were rife, though no act of treachery displayed itself.\n\nClearchus accordingly resolved to bring to an end these feelings of\n\nmistrust, before they led to war. Consequently, he sent a messenger to\n\nthe Persian to say that he desired an interview with him; to which the\n\nother readily consented. As soon as they were met, Clearchus spoke as\n\nfollows: \"Tissaphernes,\" he said, \"I do not forget that oaths have\n\nbeen exchanged between us, and right hands shaken, in token that we\n\nwill abstain from mutual injury; but I can see that you watch us\n\nnarrowly, as if we were foes; and we, seeing this, watch you narrowly\n\nin return. But as I fail to discover, after investigation, that you\n\nare endeavouring to do us a mischief--and I am quite sure that nothing\n\nof the sort has ever entered our heads with regard to you--the best\n\nplan seemed to me to come and talk the matter over with you, so that,\n\nif possible, we might dispel the mutual distrust on either side. For I\n\nhave known people ere now, the victims in some cases of calumny, or\n\npossibly of mere suspicion, who in apprehension of one another and\n\neager to deal the first blow, have committed irreparable wrong against\n\nthose who neither intended nor so much as harboured a thought of\n\nmischief against them. I have come to you under a conviction that such  6\n\nmisunderstandings may best be put a stop to by personal intercourse,\n\nand I wish to instruct you plainly that you are wrong in mistrusting\n\nus. The first and weightiest reason is that the oaths, which we took\n\nin the sight of heaven, are a barrier to mutual hostility. I envy not\n\nthe man whose conscience tells him that he has disregarded these! For\n\nin a war with heaven, by what swiftness of foot can a man escape?--in\n\nwhat quarter find refuge?--in what darkness slink away and be hid?--to\n\nwhat strong fortress scale and be out of reach? Are not all things in\n\nall ways subject to the gods? is not their lordship over all alike\n\noutspread? As touching the gods, therefore, and our oaths, that is how\n", "I view this matter. To their safe keeping we consigned the friendship\n\nwhich we solemnly contracted. But turning to matters human, you I look\n\nupon as our greatest blessing in this present time. With you every\n\npath is plain to us, every river passable, and of provisions we shall\n\nknow no stint. But without you, all our way is through darkness; for\n\nwe known nothing concerning it, every river will be an obstacle, each\n\nmultitude a terror; but, worst terror of all, the vast wilderness, so\n\nfull of endless perplexity. Nay, if in a fit of madness we murdered\n\nyou, what then? in slaying our benefactor should we not have\n\nchallenged to enter the lists against us a more formidable antagonist\n\nin the king himself? Let me tell you, how many high hopes I should rob\n\nmyself of, were I to take in hand to do you mischief.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) The Greater Zab, which flows into the Tigris near a town now\n\n    called Senn, with which most travellers identify Caenae.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"I coveted the friendship of Cyrus; I believed him to be abler than\n\nany man of his day to benefit those whom he chose; but to-day I look\n\nand, behold, it is you who are in his place; the power which belonged   11\n\nto Cyrus and his territory are yours now. You have them, and your own\n\nsatrapy besides, safe and sound; while the king's power, which was a\n\nthorn in the side of Cyrus, is your support. This being so, it would\n\nbe madness not to wish to be your friend. But I will go further and\n\nstate to you the reasons of my confidence, that you on your side will\n\ndesire our friendship. I know that the Mysians are a cause of trouble\n\nto you, and I flatter myself that with my present force I could render\n\nthem humbly obedient to you. This applies to the Pisidians also; and I\n\nam told there are many other such tribes besides. I think I can deal\n\nwith them all; they shall cease from being a constant disturbance to\n\nyour peace and prosperity. Then there are the Egyptians (2). I know\n", "your anger against them to-day is very great. Nor can I see what\n\nbetter force you will find to help you in chastising them than this\n\nwhich marches at my back to-day. Again, if you seek the friendship of\n\nany of your neighbours round, there shall be no friend so great as\n\nyou; if any one annoys you, with us as your faithful servitors you\n\nshall belord it over him; and such service we will render you, not as\n\nhirelings merely for pay's sake, but for the gratitude which we shall\n\nrightly feel to you, to whom we owe our lives. As I dwell on these\n\nmatters, I confess, the idea of your feeling mistrust of us is so\n\nastonishing, that I would give much to discover the name of the man,\n\nwho is so clever of speech that he can persuade you that we harbour\n\ndesigns against you.\" Clearchus ended, and Tissaphernes responded\n\nthus--\n\n<br/><br/>\n (2) We learn from Diodorus Siculus, xiv. 35, that the Egyptians had\n\n    revolted from the Persians towards the end of the reign of Darius.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"I am glad, Clearchus, to listen to your sensible remarks; for with\n\nthe sentiments you hold, if you were to devise any mischief against\n\nme, it could only be out of malevolence to yourself. But if you\n\nimagine that you, on your side, have any better reason to mistrust the\n\nking and me, than we you, listen to me in turn, and I will undeceive\n\nyou. I ask you, does it seem to you that we lack the means, if we had\n\nthe will, to destroy you? have we not horsemen enough, or infantry, or\n\nwhatever other arm you like, whereby we may be able to injure you,\n\nwithout risk of suffering in return? or, possibly, do we seem to you    17\n\nto lack the physical surroundings suitable for attacking you? Do you\n\nnot see all these great plains, which you find it hard enough to\n\ntraverse even when they are friendly? and all yonder great mountain\n\nchains left for you to cross, which we can at any time occupy in\n", "advance and render impassable? and all those rivers, on whose banks we\n\ncan deal craftily by you, checking and controlling and choosing the\n\nright number of you whom we care to fight! Nay, there are some which\n\nyou will not be able to cross at all, unless we transport you to the\n\nother side.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"And if at all these points we were worsted, yet 'fire,' as they say,\n\n'is stronger than the fruit of the field': we can burn it down and\n\ncall up famine in arms against you; against which you, for all your\n\nbravery, will never be able to contend. Why then, with all these\n\navenues of attack, this machinery of war, open to us, not one of which\n\ncan be turned against ourselves, why should we select from among them\n\nall that method, which alone in the sight of God is impious and of man\n\nabominable? Surely it belongs to people altogether without resources,\n\nwho are helplessly struggling in the toils of fate, and are villains\n\nto boot, to seek accomplishment of their desires by perjury to heaven\n\nand faithlessness to their fellows. We are not so unreasoning,\n\nClearchus, nor so foolish.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"Why, when we had it in our power to destroy you, did we not proceed\n\nto do it? Know well that the cause of this was nothing less than my\n\npassion to prove myself faithful to the Hellenes, and that, as Cyrus\n\nwent up, relying on a foreign force attracted by payment, I in turn\n\nmight go down strong in the same through service rendered. Various\n\nways in which you Hellenes may be useful to me you yourself have\n\nmentioned, but there is one still greater. It is the great king's\n\nprivilege alone to wear the tiara upright upon his head, yet in your\n\npresence it may be given to another mortal to wear it upright, here,\n\nupon his heart.\"\n\n<br/><br/>", "Throughout this speech he seemed to Clearchus to be speaking the\n\ntruth, and he rejoined: \"Then are not those worthy of the worst         24\n\npenalties who, in spite of all that exists to cement our friendship,\n\nendeavour by slander to make us enemies?\" \"Even so,\" replied\n\nTissaphernes, \"and if your generals and captains care to come in some\n\nopen and public way, I will name to you those who tell me that you are\n\nplotting against me and the army under me.\" \"Good,\" replied Clearchus.\n\n\"I will bring all, and I will show you, on my side, the source from\n\nwhich I derive my information concerning you.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nAfter this conversation Tissaphernes, with kindliest expression,\n\ninvited Clearchus to remain with him at the time, and entertained him\n\nat dinner. Next day Clearchus returned to the camp, and made no secret\n\nof his persuasion that he at any rate stood high in the affections of\n\nTissaphernes, and he reported what he had said, insisting that those\n\ninvited ought to go to Tissaphernes, and that any Hellene convicted of\n\ncalumnious language ought to be punished, not only as traitors\n\nthemselves, but as disaffected to their fellow-countrymen. The\n\nslanderer and traducer was Menon; so, at any rate, he suspected,\n\nbecause he knew that he had had meetings with Tissaphernes whilst he\n\nwas with Ariaeus, and was factiously opposed to himself, plotting how\n\nto win over the whole army to him, as a means of winning the good\n\ngraces of Tissaphernes. But Clearchus wanted the entire army to give\n\nits mind to no one else, and that refractory people should be put out\n\nof the way. Some of the soldiers protested: the captains and generals\n\nhad better not all go; it was better not to put too much confidence in\n\nTissaphernes. But Clearchus insisted so strongly that finally it was\n\narranged for five generals to go and twenty captains. These were\n\naccompanied by about two hundred of the other soldiers, who took the\n\nopportunity of marketing.\n", "<br/><br/>\nOn arrival at the doors of Tissaphernes's quarters the generals were\n\nsummoned inside. They were Proxenus the Boeotian, Menon the\n\nThessalian, Agias the Arcadian, Clearchus the Laconian, and Socrates\n\nthe Achaean; while the captains remained at the doors. Not long after\n\nthat, at one and the same signal, those within were seized and those\n\nwithout cut down; after which some of the barbarian horsemen galloped\n\nover the plain, killing every Hellene they encountered, bond or free.   32\n\nThe Hellenes, as they looked from the camp, viewed that strange\n\nhorsemanship with surprise, and could not explain to themselves what\n\nit all meant, until Nicarchus the Arcadian came tearing along for bare\n\nlife with a wound in the belly, and clutching his protruding entrails\n\nin his hands. He told them all that had happened. Instantly the\n\nHellenes ran to their arms, one and all, in utter consternation, and\n\nfully expecting that the enemy would instantly be down upon the camp.\n\nHowever, they did not all come; only Ariaeus came, and Artaozus and\n\nMithridates, who were Cyrus's most faithful friends; but the\n\ninterpreter of the Hellenes said he saw and recognised the brother of\n\nTissaphernes also with them. They had at their back other Persians\n\nalso, armed with cuirasses, as many as three hundred. As soon as they\n\nwere within a short distance, they bade any general or captain of the\n\nHellenes who might be there to approach and hear a message from the\n\nking. After this, two Hellene generals went out with all precaution.\n\nThese were Cleanor the Orchomenian (3), and Sophaenetus the\n\nStymphalion, attended by Xenophon the Athenian, who went to learn news\n\nof Proxenus. Cheirisophus was at the time away in a village with a\n\nparty gathering provisions. As soon as they had halted within earshot,\n\nAriaeus said: \"Hellenes, Clearchus being shown to have committed\n\nperjury and to have broken the truce, has suffered the penalty, and he\n\nis dead; but Proxenus and Menon, in return for having given\n", "information of his treachery, are in high esteem and honour. As to\n\nyourselves, the king demands your arms. He claims them as his, since\n\nthey belonged to Cyrus, who was his slave.\" To this the Hellenes made\n\nanswer by the mouth of Cleanor of Orchomenus, their spokesman, who\n\nsaid, addressing Ariaeus: \"Thou villain, Ariaeus, and you the rest of\n\nyou, who were Cyrus's friends, have you no shame before God or man,\n\nfirst to swear to us that you have the same friends and the same\n\nenemies as we ourselves, and then to turn and betray us, making common\n\ncause with Tissaphernes, that most impious and villainous of men? With\n\nhim you have murdered the very men to whom you gave your solemn word\n\nand oath, and to the rest of us turned traitors; and, having so done,   39\n\nyou join hand with our enemies to come against us.\" Ariaeus answered:\n\n\"There is no doubt but that Clearchus has been known for some time to\n\nharbour designs against Tissaphernes and Orontas, and all of us who\n\nside with them.\" Taking up this assertion, Xenophon said: \"Well, then,\n\ngranting that Clearchus broke the truce contrary to our oaths, he has\n\nhis deserts, for perjurers deserve to perish; but where are Proxenus\n\nand Menon, our generals and your good friends and benefactors, as you\n\nadmit? Send them back to us. Surely, just because they are friends of\n\nboth parites, they will try to give us the best advice for you and for\n\nus.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nAt this, the Asiatics stood discussing with one another for a long\n\nwhile, and then they went away without vouchsafing a word.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nVI\n\n<br/><br/>", "The generals who were thus seized were taken up to the king and there   1\n\ndecapitated. The first of these, Clearchus, was a thorough soldier,\n\nand a true lover of fighting. This is the testimony of all who knew\n\nhim intimately. As long as the war between the Lacedaemonians and\n\nAthenians lasted, he could find occupation at home; but after the\n\npeace, he persuaded his own city that the Thracians were injuring the\n\nHellenes, and having secured his object, set sail, empowered by the\n\nephorate to make war upon the Thracians north of the Chersonese and\n\nPerinthus. But he had no sooner fairly started than, for some reason\n\nor other, the ephors changed their minds, and endeavoured to bring him\n\nback again from the isthmus. Thereupon he refused further obedience,\n\nand went off with sails set for the Hellespont. In consequence he was\n\ncondemned to death by the Spartan authorities for disobedience to\n\norders; and now, finding himself an exile, he came to Cyrus. Working\n\non the feelings of that prince, in language described elsewhere, he\n\nreceived from his entertainer a present of ten thousand darics. Having\n\ngot this money, he did not sink into a life of ease and indolence, but\n\ncollected an army with it, carried on war against the Thracians, and    5\n\nconquered them in battle, and from that date onwards harried and\n\nplundered them with war incessantly, until Cyrus wanted his army;\n\nwhereupon he at once went off, in hopes of finding another sphere of\n\nwarfare in his company.\n\n<br/><br/>\nThese, I take it, were the characteristic acts of a man whose\n\naffections are set on warfare. When it is open to him to enjoy peace\n\nwith honour, no shame, no injury attached, still he prefers war; when\n\nhe may live at home at ease, he insists on toil, if only it may end in\n\nfighting; when it is given to him to keep his riches without risk, he\n\nwould rather lessen his fortune by the pastime of battle. To put it\n\nbriefly, war was his mistress; just as another man will spend his\n", "fortune on a favourite, or to gratify some pleasure, so he chose to\n\nsquander his substance on soldiering.\n\n<br/><br/>\nBut if the life of a soldier was a passion with him, he was none the\n\nless a soldier born, as herein appears; danger was a delight to him;\n\nhe courted it, attacking the enemy by night or by day; and in\n\ndifficulties he did not lose his head, as all who ever served in a\n\ncampaign with him would with one consent allow. A good solder! the\n\nquestion arises, Was he equally good as a commander? It must be\n\nadmitted that, as far as was compatible with his quality of temper, he\n\nwas; none more so. Capable to a singular degree of devising how his\n\narmy was to get supplies, and of actually getting them, he was also\n\ncapable of impressing upon those about him that Clearchus must be\n\nobeyed; and that he brought about by the very hardness of his nature.\n\nWith a scowling expression and a harshly-grating voice, he chastised\n\nwith severity, and at times with such fury, that he was sorry\n\nafterwards himself for what he had done. Yet it was not without\n\npurpose that he applied the whip; he had a theory that there was no\n\ngood to be got out of an unchastened army. A saying of his is recorded\n\nto the effect that the soldier who is to mount guard and keep his\n\nhands off his friends, and be ready to dash without a moment's\n\nhesitation against the foe--must fear his commander more than the\n\nenemy. Accordingly, in any strait, this was the man whom the soldiers\n\nwere eager to obey, and they would have no other in his place. The      11\n\ncloud which lay upon his brow, at those times lit up with brightness;\n\nhis face became radiant, and the old sternness was so charged with\n\nvigour and knitted strength to meet the foe, that it savoured of\n\nsalvation, not of cruelty. But when the pinch of danger was past, and\n\nit was open to them to go and taste subordination under some other\n\nofficer, many forsook him. So lacking in grace of manner was he; but\n", "was ever harsh and savage, so that the feeling of the soldiers towards\n\nhim was that of schoolboys to a master. In other words, though it was\n\nnot his good fortune ever to have followers inspired solely by\n\nfriendship or goodwill, yet those who found themselves under him,\n\neither by State appointment or through want, or other arch necessity,\n\nyielded him implicit obedience. From the moment that he led them to\n\nvictory, the elements which went to make his soldiers efficient were\n\nnumerous enough. There was the feeling of confidence in facing the\n\nfoe, which never left them, and there was the dread of punishment at\n\nhis hands to keep them orderly. In this way and to this extent he knew\n\nhow to rule; but to play a subordinate part himself he had no great\n\ntaste; so, at any rate, it was said. At the time of his death he must\n\nhave been about fifty years of age.\n\n<br/><br/>\nProxenus, the Boeotian, was of a different temperament. It had been\n\nthe dream of his boyhood to become a man capable of great\n\nachievements. In obedience to this passionate desire it was, that he\n\npaid his fee to Gorgias of Leontini (1). After enojoying that teacher's\n\nsociety, he flattered himself that he must be at once qualified to\n\nrule; and while he was on friendly terms with the leaders of the age,\n\nhe was not to be outdone in reciprocity of service (2). In this mood he  17\n\nthrew himself into the projects of Cyrus, and in return expected to\n\nderive from this essay the reward of a great name, large power, and\n\nwide wealth. But for all that he pitched his hopes so high, it was\n\nnone the less evident that he would refuse to gain any of the ends he\n\nset before him wrongfully. Righteously and honourably he would obtain\n\nthem, if he might, or else forego them. As a commander he had the art\n\nof leading gentlemen, but he failed to inspire adequately either\n\nrespect for himself or fear in the soldiers under him. Indeed, he\n\nshowed a more delicate regard for his soldiers than his subordinates\n", "for him, and he was indisputably more apprehensive of incurring their\n\nhatred than they were of losing their fidelity. The one thing needful\n\nto real and recognised generalship was, he thought, to praise the\n\nvirtuous and to withhold praise from the evildoer. It can be easily\n\nunderstood, then, that of those who were brought in contact with him,\n\nthe good and noble indeed were his well-wishers; but he laid himself\n\nopen to the machinations of the base, who looked upon him as a person\n\nto be dealt with as they liked. At the time of his death he was only\n\nthirty years of age.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) The famous rhetorician of Leontini, 485-380 B.C. His fee was 100\n\n    minae.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (2) Proxenus, like Cyrus, is to some extent a prototype of the Cyrus\n\n    of the \"Cyropaedia.\" In other words, the author, in delineating\n\n    the portrait of his ideal prince, drew from the recollection of\n\n    many princely qualities observed by him in the characters of many\n\n    friends. Apart from the intrinsic charm of the story, the\n\n    \"Anabasis\" is interesting as containing the raw material of\n\n    experience and reflection which \"this young scholar or\n\n    philosopher,\" our friend, the author, will one day turn to\n\n    literary account.\n\n<br/><br/>\nAs to Menon the Thessalian (3), the mainspring of his action was\n\nobvious; what he sought after insatiably was wealth. Rule he sought\n\nafter only as a stepping-stone to larger spoils. Honours and high\n\nestate he craved for simply that he might extend the area of his\n\ngains; and if he studied to be on friendly terms with the powerful, it\n\nwas in order that he might commit wrong with impunity. The shortest\n\nroad to the achievement of his desires lay, he thought, through false\n", "swearing, lying, and cheating; for in his vocabulary simplicity and\n\ntruth were synonyms of folly. Natural affection he clearly entertained\n\nfor nobody. If he called a man his friend it might be looked upon as    23\n\ncertain that he was bent on ensnaring him. Laughter at an enemy he\n\nconsidered out of place, but his whole conversation turned upon the\n\nridicule of his associates. In like manner, the possessions of his\n\nfoes were secure from his designs, since it was no easy task, he\n\nthought, to steal from people on their guard; but it was his\n\nparticular good fortune to have discovered how easy it is to rob a\n\nfriend in the midst of his security. If it were a perjured person or a\n\nwrongdoer, he dreaded him as well armed and intrenched; but the\n\nhonourable and the truth-loving he tried to practise on, regarding\n\nthem as weaklings devoid of manhood. And as other men pride themselves\n\non piety and truth and righteousness, so Menon prided himself on a\n\ncapacity for fraud, on the fabrication of lies, on the mockery and\n\nscorn of friends. The man who was not a rogue he ever looked upon as\n\nonly half educated. Did he aspire to the first place in another man's\n\nfriendship, he set about his object by slandering those who stood\n\nnearest to him in affection. He contrived to secure the obedience of\n\nhis solders by making himself an accomplice in their misdeeds, and the\n\nfluency with which he vaunted his own capacity and readiness for\n\nenormous guilt was a sufficient title to be honoured and courted by\n\nthem. Or if any one stood aloof from him, he set it down as a\n\nmeritorious act of kindness on his part that during their intercourse\n\nhe had not robbed him of existence.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (3) For a less repulsive conception of Menon's character, however\n\n    unhistorical, see Plato's \"Meno,\" and Prof. Jowlett's\n\n    Introduction, \"Plato,\" vol. i. p. 265: \"He is a Thessalian\n\n    Alcibiades, rich and luxurious--a spoilt child of fortune.\"\n", "<br/><br/>\nAs to certain obscure charges brought against his character, these may\n\ncertainly be fabrications. I confine myself to the following facts,\n\nwhich are known to all. He was in the bloom of youth when he procured\n\nfrom Aristippus the command of his mercenaries; he had not yet lost\n\nthat bloom when he became exceedingly intimate with Ariaeus, a\n\nbarbarian, whose liking for fair young men was the explanation; and\n\nbefore he had grown a beard himself, he had contracted a similar\n\nrelationship with a bearded favourite named Tharypas. When his\n\nfellow-generals were put to death on the plea that they had marched\n\nwith Cyrus against the king, he alone, although he had shared their\n\nconduct, was exempted from their fate. But after their deaths the\n\nvengeance of the king fell upon him, and he was put to death, not like  29\n\nClearchus and the others by what would appear to be the speediest of\n\ndeaths--decapitation--but, as report says, he lived for a year in pain\n\nand disgrace and died the death of a felon.\n\n<br/><br/>\nAgias the Arcadian and Socrates the Achaean were both among the\n\nsufferers who were put to death. To the credit, be it said, of both,\n\nno one ever derided either as cowardly in war: no one ever had a fault\n\nto find with either on the score of friendship. They were both about\n\nthirty-five years of age.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nBOOK III\n\n<br/><br/>\n (In the preceding pages of the narrative will be found a full\n", "account, not only of the doings of the Hellenes during the\n\nadvance of Cyrus till the date of the battle, but of the\n\nincidents which befell them after Cyrus' death at the\n\ncommencement of the retreat, while in company with\n\nTissaphernes during the truce.)\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nI\n\n<br/><br/>\nAfter the generals had been seized, and the captains and soldiers who   1\n\nformed their escort had been killed, the Hellenes lay in deep\n\nperplexity--a prey to painful reflections. Here were they at the\n\nking's gates, and on every side environing them were many hostile\n\ncities and tribes of men. Who was there now to furnish them with a\n\nmarket? Separated from Hellas by more than a thousand miles, they had\n\nnot even a guide to point the way. Impassable rivers lay athwart their\n\nhomeward route, and hemmed them in. Betrayed even by the Asiatics, at\n\nwhose side they had marched with Cyrus to the attack, they were left\n\nin isolation. Without a single mounted trooper to aid them in pursuit:\n\nwas it not perfectly plain that if they won a battle, their enemies\n\nwould escape to a man, but if they were beaten themselves, not one\n\nsoul of them would survive?\n\n<br/><br/>\nHaunted by such thoughts, and with hearts full of despair, but few of\n\nthem tasted food that evening; but few of them kindled even a fire,\n\nand many never came into camp at all that night, but took their rest\n\nwhere each chanced to be. They could not close their eyes for very\n\npain and yearning after their fatherlands or their parents, the wife\n", "or child whom they never expected to look upon again. Such was the\n\nplight in which each and all tried to seek repose.\n\n<br/><br/>\nNow there was in that host a certain man, an Athenian (1), Xenophon,\n\nwho had accompanied Cyrus, neither as a general, nor as an officer,\n\nnor yet as a private soldier, but simply on the invitation of an old\n\nfriend, Proxenus. This old friend had sent to fetch him from home,\n\npromising, if he would come, to introduce him to Cyrus, \"whom,\" said\n\nProxenus, \"I consider to be worth my fatherland and more to me.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) The reader should turn to Grote's comments on the first appearance\n\n    of Xenophon. He has been mentioned before, of course, more than\n\n    once before; but he now steps, as the protagonist, upon the scene,\n\n    and as Grote says: \"It is in true Homeric vein, and in something\n\n    like Homeric language, that Xenophon (to whom we owe the whole\n\n    narrative of the expedition) describes his dream, or the\n\n    intervention of Oneiros, sent by Zeus, from which this renovating\n\n    impulse took its rise.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nXenophon having read the letter, consulted Socrates the Athenian,\n\nwhether he should accept or refuse the invitation. Socrates, who had a\n\nsuspicion that the State of Athens might in some way look askance at\n\nmy friendship with Cyrus, whose zealous co-operation with the\n\nLacedaemonians against Athens in the war was not forgotten, advised\n\nXenophon to go to Delphi and there to consult the god as to the\n\ndesirability of such a journey. Xenophon went and put the question to\n\nApollo, to which of the gods he must pray and do sacrifice, so that he\n\nmight best accomplish his intended journey and return in safety, with\n\ngood fortune. Then Apollo answered him: \"To such and such gods must\n\nthou do sacrifice,\" and when he had returned home he reported to\n", "Socrates the oracle. But he, when he heard, blamed Xenophon that he\n\nhad not, in the first instance, inquired of the god, whether it were\n\nbetter for him to go or to stay, but had taken on himself to settle\n\nthat point affirmatively, by inquiring straightway, how he might best   7\n\nperform the journey. \"Since, however,\" continued Socrates, \"you did so\n\nput the question, you should do what the god enjoined.\" Thus, and\n\nwithout further ado, Xenophon offered sacrifice to those whom the god\n\nhad named, and set sail on his voyage. He overtook Proxenus and Cyrus\n\nat Sardis, when they were just ready to start on the march up country,\n\nand was at once introduced to Cyrus. Proxenus eagerly pressed him to\n\nstop--a request which Cyrus with like ardour supported, adding that as\n\nsoon as the campaign was over he would send him home. The campaign\n\nreferred to was understood to be against the Pisidians. That is how\n\nXenophon came to join the expedition, deceived indeed, though not by\n\nProxenus, who was equally in the dark with the rest of the Hellenes,\n\nnot counting Clearchus, as to the intended attack upon the king. Then,\n\nthough the majority were in apprehension of the journey, which was not\n\nat all to their minds, yet, for very shame of one another and Cyrus,\n\nthey continued to follow him, and with the rest went Xenophon.\n\n<br/><br/>\nAnd now in this season of perplexity, he too, with the rest, was in\n\nsore distress, and could not sleep; but anon, getting a snatch of\n\nsleep, he had a dream. It seemed to him in a vision that there was a\n\nstorm of thunder and lightning, and a bolt fell on his father's house,\n\nand thereupon the house was all in a blaze. He sprung up in terror,\n\nand pondering the matter, decided that in part the dream was good: in\n\nthat he had seen a great light from Zeus, whilst in the midst of toil\n\nand danger. But partly too he feared it, for evidently it had come\n\nfrom Zeus the king. And the fire kindled all around--what could that\n\nmean but that he was hemmed in by various perplexities, and so could\n", "not escape from the country of the king? The full meaning, however, is\n\nto be discovered from what happened after the dream.\n\n<br/><br/>\nThis is what took place. As soon as he was fully awake, the first\n\nclear thought which came into his head was, Why am I lying here? The\n\nnight advances; with the day, it is like enough, the enemy will be\n\nupon us. If we are to fall into the hands of the king, what is left us\n\nbut to face the most horrible of sights, and to suffer the most         13\n\nfearful pains, and then to die, insulted, an ignominious death? To\n\ndefend ourselves--to ward off that fate--not a hand stirs: no one is\n\npreparing, none cares; but here we lie, as though it were time to rest\n\nand take our ease. I too! what am I waiting for? a general to\n\nundertake the work? and from what city? am I waiting till I am older\n\nmysef and of riper age? older I shall never be, if to-day I betray\n\nmyself to my enemies.\n\n<br/><br/>\nThereupon he got up, and called together first Proxenus's officers;\n\nand when they were met, he said: \"Sleep, sirs, I cannot, nor can you,\n\nI fancy, nor lie here longer, when I see in what straits we are. Our\n\nenemy, we may be sure, did not open war upon us till he felt he had\n\neverything amply ready; yet none of us shows a corresponding anxiety\n\nto enter the lists of battle in the bravest style.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"And yet, if we yield ourselves and fall into the king's power, need\n\nwe ask what our fate will be? This man, who, when his own brother, the\n\nson of the same parents, was dead, was not content with that, but\n\nsevered head and hand from the body, and nailed them to a cross. We,\n\nthen, who have not even the tie of blood in our favour, but who\n\nmarched against him, meaning to make a slave of him instead of a\n\nking--and to slay him if we could: what is likely to be our fate at\n", "his hands? Will he not go all lengths so that, by inflicting on us the\n\nextreme of ignominy and torture, he may rouse in the rest of mankind a\n\nterror of ever marching against him any more? There is no question but\n\nthat our business is to avoid by all means getting into his clutches.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"For my part, all the while the truce lasted, I never ceased pitying\n\nourselves and congratulating the king and those with him, as, like a\n\nhelpless spectator, I surveyed the extent and quality of their\n\nterritory, the plenteousness of their provisions, the multitude of\n\ntheir dependants, their cattle, their gold, and their apparel. And\n\nthen to turn and ponder the condition of our soldiers, without part or\n\nlot in these good things, except we bought it; few, I knew, had any\n\nlonger the wherewithal to buy, and yet our oath held us down, so that\n\nwe could not provide ourselves otherwise than by purchase. I say, as I  21\n\nreasoned thus, there were times when I dreaded the truce more than I\n\nnow dread war.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"Now, however, that they have abruptly ended the truce, there is an\n\nend also to their own insolence and to our suspicion. All these good\n\nthings of theirs are now set as prizes for the combatants. To\n\nwhichsoever of us shall prove the better men, will they fall as\n\nguerdons; and the gods themselves are the judges of the strife. The\n\ngods, who full surely will be on our side, seeing it is our enemies\n\nwho have taken their names falsely; whilst we, with much to lure us,\n\nyet for our oath's sake, and the gods who were our witnesses, sternly\n\nheld aloof. So that, it seems to me, we have a right to enter upon\n\nthis contest with much more heart than our foes; and further, we are\n\npossessed of bodies more capable than theirs of bearing cold and heat\n\nand labour; souls too we have, by the help of heaven, better and\n\nbraver; nay, the men themselves are more vulnerable, more mortal, than\n", "ourselves, if so be the gods vouchsafe to give us victory once again.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"Howbeit, for I doubt not elsewhere similar reflections are being\n\nmade, whatsoever betide, let us not, in heaven's name, wait for others\n\nto come and challenge us to noble deeds; let us rather take the lead\n\nin stimulating the rest to valour. Show yourselves to be the bravest\n\nof officers, and among generals, the worthiest to command. For myself,\n\nif you choose to start forwards on this quest, I will follow; or, if\n\nyou bid me lead you, my age shall be no excuse to stand between me and\n\nyour orders. At least I am of full age, I take it, to avert misfortune\n\nfrom my own head.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nSuch were the speaker's words; and the officers, when they heard, all,\n\nwith one exception, called upon him to put himself at their head. This\n\nwas a certain Apollonides there present, who spoke in the Boeotian\n\ndialect. This man's opinion was that it was mere nonsense for any one\n\nto pretend they could obtain safety otherwise than by an appeal to the\n\nking, if he had skill to enforce it; and at the same time he began to\n\ndilate on the difficulties. But Xenophon cut him short. \"O most\n\nmarvellous of men! though you have eyes to see, you do not perceive;\n\nthough you have ears to hear, you do not recollect. You were present    27\n\nwith the rest of us now here when, after the death of Cyrus, the king,\n\nvaunting himself on that occurrence, sent dictatorially to bid us lay\n\ndown our arms. But when we, instead of giving up our arms, put them on\n\nand went and pitched our camp near him, his manner changed. It is hard\n\nto say what he did not do, he was so at his wit's end, sending us\n\nembassies and begging for a truce, and furnishing provisions the\n\nwhile, until he had got it. Or to take the contrary instance, when\n\njust now, acting precisely on your principles, our generals and\n\ncaptains went, trusting to the truce, unarmed to a conference with\n", "them, what came of it? what is happening at this instant? Beaten,\n\ngoaded with pricks, insulted, poor souls, they cannot even die: though\n\ndeath, I ween, would be very sweet. And you, who know all this, how\n\ncan you say that it is mere nonsense to talk of self-defence? how can\n\nyou bid us go again and try the arts of persuasion? In my opinion,\n\nsirs, we ought not to admit this fellow to the same rank with\n\nourselves; rather ought we to deprive him of his captaincy, and load\n\nhim with packs and treat him as such. The man is a disgrace to his own\n\nfatherland and the whole of Hellas, that, being a Hellene, he is what\n\nhe is.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nHere Agasias the Stymphalian broke in, exclaiming: \"Nay, this fellow\n\nhas no connection either with Boeotia or with Hellas, none whatever. I\n\nhave noted both his ears bored like a Lydian's.\" And so it was. Him\n\nthen they banished. But the rest visited the ranks, and wherever a\n\ngeneral was left, they summoned the general; where he was gone, the\n\nlieutenant-general; and where again the captain alone was left, the\n\ncaptain. As soon as they were all met, they seated themselves in front\n\nof the place d'armes: the assembled generals and officers, numbering\n\nabout a hundred. It was nearly midnight when this took place.\n\n<br/><br/>\nThereupon Hieronymous the Eleian, the eldest of Proxenus's captains,\n\ncommenced speaking as follows: \"Generals and captains, it seemed right\n\nto us, in view of the present crisis, ourselves to assemble and to\n\nsummon you, that we might advise upon some practicable course. Would\n\nyou, Xenophon, repeat what you said to us?\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nThereupon Xenophon spoke as follows: \"We all know only too well, that   34\n\nthe king and Tissaphernes have seized as many of us as they could, and\n\nit is clear they are plotting to destroy the rest of us if they can.\n", "Our business is plain: it is to do all we can to avoid getting into\n\nthe power of the barbarians; rather, if we can, we will get them into\n\nour power. Rely upon this then, all you who are here assembled, now is\n\nyour great opportunity. The soldiers outside have their eyes fixed\n\nupon you; if they think that you are faint-hearted, they will turn\n\ncowards; but if you show them that you are making your own\n\npreparations to attack the enemy, and setting an example to the\n\nrest--follow you, be assured, they will: imitate you they will. May\n\nbe, it is but right and fair that you should somewhat excel them, for\n\nyou are generals, you are commanders of brigades or regiments; and if,\n\nwhile it was peace, you had the advantage in wealth and position, so\n\nnow, when it is war, you are expected to rise superior to the common\n\nherd--to think for them, to toil for them, whenever there be need.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"At this very moment you would confer a great boon on the army, if you\n\nmade it your business to appoint generals and officers to fill the\n\nplaces of those that are lost. For without leaders nothing good or\n\nnoble, to put it concisely, was ever wrought anywhere; and in military\n\nmatters this is absolutely true; for if discipline is held to be of\n\nsaving virtue, the want of it has been the ruin of many ere now. Well,\n\nthen! when you have appointed all the commanders necessary, it would\n\nonly be opportune, I take it, if you were to summon the rest of the\n\nsoldiers and speak some words of encouragement. Even now, I daresay\n\nyou noticed yourselves the crestfallen air with which they came into\n\ncamp, the despondency with which they fell to picket duty, so that,\n\nunless there is a change for the better, I do not know for what\n\nservice they will be fit; whether by night, if need were, or even by\n\nday. The thing is to get them to turn their thoughts to what they mean\n\nto do, instead of to what they are likely to suffer. Do that, and\n\ntheir spirits will soon revive wonderfully. You know, I need hardly\n", "remind you, it is not numbers or strength that gives victory in war;\n\nbut, heaven helping them, to one or other of two combatants it is       42\n\ngiven to dash with stouter hearts to meet the foe, and such onset, in\n\nnine cases out of ten, those others refuse to meet. This observation,\n\nalso, I have laid to heart, that they, who in matters of war seek in\n\nall ways to save their lives, are just they who, as a rule, die\n\ndishonourably; whereas they who, recognising that death is the common\n\nlot and destiny of all men, strive hard to die nobly: these more\n\nfrequently, as I observe, do after all attain to old age, or, at any\n\nrate, while life lasts, they spend their days more happily. This\n\nlesson let all lay to heart this day, for we are just at such a crisis\n\nof our fate. Now is the season to be brave ourselves, and to stimulate\n\nthe rest by our example.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nWith these words he ceased; and after him, Cheirisophus said:\n\n\"Xenophon, hitherto I knew only so much of you as that you were, I\n\nheard, an Athenian, but now I must commend you for your words and for\n\nyour conduct. I hope that there may be many more like you, for it\n\nwould prove a public blessing.\" Then turning to the officers: \"And\n\nnow,\" said he, \"let us waste no time; retire at once, I beg you, and\n\nchoose leaders where you need them. After you have made your\n\nelections, come back to the middle of the camp, and bring the newly\n\nappointed officers. After that, we will there summon a general meeting\n\nof the soldiers. Let Tolmides, the herald,\" he added, \"be in\n\nattendance.\" With these words on his lips he got up, in order that\n\nwhat was needful might be done at once without delay. After this the\n\ngenerals were chosen. These were Timasion the Dardanian, in place of\n\nClearchus; Xanthicles, an Achaean, in place of Socrates; Cleanor, an\n\nArcadian, in place of Agias; Philesius, an Achaean, in place of Menon;\n\nand in place of Proxenus, Xenophon the Athenian.\n", "<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nII\n\n<br/><br/>\nBy the time the new generals had been chosen, the first faint glimmer   1\n\nof dawn had hardly commenced, as they met in the centre of the camp,\n\nand resolved to post an advance guard and to call a general meeting of\n\nthe soldiers. Now, when these had come together, Cheirisophus the\n\nLacedaemonian first rose and spoke as follows: \"Fellow-soldiers, the\n\npresent posture of affairs is not pleasant, seeing that we are robbed\n\nof so many generals and captains and soldiers; and more than that, our  2\n\nformer allies, Ariaeus and his men, have betrayed us; still, we must\n\nrise above our circumstances to prove ourselves brave men, and not\n\ngive in, but try to save ourselves by glorious victory if we can; or,\n\nif not, at least to die gloriously, and never, while we have breath in\n\nour bodies, fall into the hands of our enemies. In which latter case,\n\nI fear, we shall suffer things, which I pray the gods may visit rather\n\nupon those we hate.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nAt this point Cleanor the Ochomenian stood up and spoke as follows:\n\n\"You see, men, the perjury and the impiety of the king. You see the\n\nfaithlessness of Tissaphernes, professing that he was next-door\n\nneighbour to Hellas, and would give a good deal to save us, in\n\nconfirmation of which he took an oath to us himself, he gave us the\n\npledge of his right hand, and then, with a lie upon his lips, this\n\nsame man turned round and arrested our generals. He had no reverence\n\neven for Zeus, the god of strangers; but, after entertaining Clearchus\n\nat his own board as a friend, he used his hospitality to delude and\n", "decoy his victims. And Ariaeus, whom we offered to make king, with\n\nwhom we exchanged pledges not to betray each other, even this man,\n\nwithout a particle of fear of the gods, or respect for Cyrus in his\n\ngrave, though he was most honoured by Cyrus in lifetime, even he has\n\nturned aside to the worst foes of Cyrus, and is doing his best to\n\ninjure the dead man's friends. Them may the gods requite as they\n\ndeserve! But we, with these things before our eyes, will not any more\n\nbe cheated and cajoled by them; we will make the best fight we can,\n\nand having made it, whatever the gods think fit to send, we will\n\naccept.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nAfter him Xenophon arose; he was arrayed for war in his bravest\n\napparel (1): \"For,\" said he to himself, \"if the gods grant victory, the\n\nfinest attire will match with victory best; or if I must needs die,\n\nthen for one who has aspired to the noblest, it is well there should\n\nbe some outward correspondence between his expectation and his end.\"\n\nHe began his speech as follows: \"Cleanor has spoken of the perjury and  8\n\nfaithlessness of the barbarians, and you yourselves know them only too\n\nwell, I fancy. If then we are minded to enter a second time into terms\n\nof friendship with them, with the experience of what our generals, who\n\nin all confidence entrusted themselves to their power, have suffered,\n\nreason would we should feel deep despondency. If, on the other hand,\n\nwe purpose to take our good swords in our hands and to inflict\n\npunishment on them for what they have done, and from this time forward\n\nwill be on terms of downright war with them, then, God helping, we\n\nhave many a bright hope of safety.\" The words were scarcely spoken\n\nwhen someone sneezed (2), and with one impulse the soldiers bowed in\n\nworship; and Xenophon proceeded: \"I propose, sirs, since, even as we\n\nspoke of safety, an omen from Zeus the Saviour has appeared, we vow a\n\nvow to sacrifice to the Saviour thank-offerings for safe deliverance,\n", "wheresoever first we reach a friendly country; and let us couple with\n\nthat vow another of individual assent, that we will offer to the rest\n\nof the gods 'according to our ability.' Let all those who are in\n\nfavour of this proposal hold up their hands.\" They all held up their\n\nhands, and there and then they vowed a vow and chanted the battle\n\nhymn. But as soon as these sacred matters were duly ended, he began\n\nonce more thus: \"I was saying that many and bright are the hopes we\n\nhave of safety. First of all, we it is who confirm and ratify the\n\noaths we take by heaven, but our enemies have taken false oaths and\n\nbroken the truce, contrary to their solemn word. This being so, it is\n\nbut natural that the gods should be opposed to our enemies, but with\n\nourselves allied; the gods, who are able to make the great ones\n\nquickly small, and out of sore perplexity can save the little ones\n\nwith ease, what time it pleases them. In the next place, let me recall\n\nto your minds the dangers of our own forefathers, that you may see and  11\n\nknow that bravery is your heirloom, and that by the aid of the gods\n\nbrave men are rescued even out of the midst of sorest straits.\" So was\n\nit when the Persians came, and their attendant hosts (3), with a very\n\ngreat armament, to wipe out Athens from the face of the earth--the men\n\nof Athens had the heart to withstand them and conquered them. Then\n\nthey vowed to Artemis that for every man they slew of the enemy, they\n\nwould sacrifice to the goddess goats so many; and when they could not\n\nfind sufficient for the slain, they resolved to offer yearly five\n\nhundred; and to this day they perform that sacrifice. And at a\n\nsomewhat later date, when Xerxes assembled his countless hosts and\n\nmarched upon Hellas, then (4) too our fathers conquered the forefathers\n\nof our foes by land and by sea.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) So it is said of the Russian General Skobelef, that he had a\n\n    strange custom of going into battle in his cleanest uniform,\n", "    perfumed, and wearing a diamond-hilted sword, \"in order that,\" as\n\n    he said, \"he might die in his best attire.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\n (2) For this ancient omen see \"Odyssey,\" xvii. 541: \"Even as she\n\n    spake, and Telemachus sneezed loudly, and around the roof rung\n\n    wondrously. And Penelope laughed.\"... \"Dost thou not mark how\n\n    my son has sneezed a blessing on all my words?\"\n\n<br/><br/>\n (3) See Herod. vi. 114; the allusion is to the invasion of Greeze by\n\n    Datis and Artaphernes, and to their defeat at Marathon, B.C. 490.\n\n    \"Heredotus estimates the number of those who fell on the Persian\n\n    side at 6400 men: the number of Athenian dead is accurately known,\n\n    since all were collected for the last solemn obsequies--they were\n\n    192.\"--Grote, \"Hist. of Greece,\" vol. v. p. 475.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (4) Then = at Salamis, B.C. 480, and at Plataea and Mycale, B.C. 479,\n\n    on the same day.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"And proofs of these things are yet to be seen in trophies; but the\n\ngreatest witness of all is the freedom of our cities--the liberty of\n\nthat land in which you were born and bred. For you call no man master\n\nor lord; you bow your heads to none save to the gods alone. Such were\n\nyour forefathers, and their sons are ye. Think not I am going to say\n\nthat you put to shame in any way your ancestry--far from it. Not many\n\ndays since, you too were drawn up in battle face to face with these\n\ntrue descendants of their ancestors, and by the help of heaven you\n\nconquered them, though they many times outnumbered you. At that time,\n\nit was to win a throne for Cyrus that you showed your bravery; to-day,\n\nwhen the struggle is for your own salvation, what is more natural than\n\nthat you should show yourselves braver and more zealous still. Nay, it\n", "is very meet and right that you should be more undaunted still to-day\n\nto face the foe. The other day, though you had not tested them, and\n\nbefore your eyes lay their immeasurable host, you had the heart to go\n\nagainst them with the spirit of your fathers. To-day you have made      16\n\ntrial of them, and knowing that, however many times your number, they\n\ndo not care to await your onset, what concern have you now to be\n\nafraid of them?\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"Nor let any one suppose that herein is a point of weakness, in that\n\nCyrus's troops, who before were drawn up by your side, have now\n\ndeserted us, for they are even worse cowards still than those we\n\nworsted. At any rate they have deserted us, and sought refuge with\n\nthem. Leaders of the forlorn hope of flight--far better is it to have\n\nthem brigaded with the enemy than shoulder to shoulder in our ranks.\n\nBut if any of you is out of heart to think that we have no cavalry,\n\nwhile the enemy have many squadrons to command, lay to heart this\n\ndoctrine, that ten thousand horse only equal ten thousand men upon\n\ntheir backs, neither less nor more. Did any one ever die in battle\n\nfrom the bite or kick of a horse? It is the men, the real swordsmen,\n\nwho do whatever is done in battles. In fact we, on our stout shanks,\n\nare better mounted than those cavalry fellows; there they hang on to\n\ntheir horses' necks in mortal dread, not only of us, but of falling\n\noff; while we, well planted upon earth, can deal far heavier blows to\n\nour assailants, and aim more steadily at who we will. There is one\n\npoint, I admit, in which their cavalry have the whip-hand of us; it is\n\nsafer for them than it is for us to run away.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"May be, however, you are in good heart about the fighting, but\n\nannoyed to think that Tissaphernes will not guide us any more, and\n\nthat the king will not furnish us with a market any longer. Now,\n", "consider, is it better for us to have a guide like Tissaphernes, whom\n\nwe know to be plotting against us, or to take our chance of the stray\n\npeople whom we catch and compel to guide us, who will know that any\n\nmistake made in leading us will be a sad mistake for their own lives?\n\nAgain, is it better to be buying provisions in a market of their\n\nproviding, in scant measure and at high prices, without even the money\n\nto pay for them any longer; or, by right of conquest, to help\n\nourselves, applying such measure as suits our fancy best?\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"Or again, perhaps you admit that our present position is not without\n\nits advantages, but you feel sure that the rivers are a difficulty,\n\nand think that you were never more taken in than when you crossed       22\n\nthem; if so, consider whether, after all, this is not perhaps the most\n\nfoolish thing which the barbarians have done. No river is impassable\n\nthroughout; whatever difficulties it may present at some distance from\n\nits source, you need only make your way up to the springhead, and\n\nthere you may cross it without wetting more than your ankles. But,\n\ngranted that the rivers do bar our passage, and that guides are not\n\nforthcoming, what care we? We need feel no alarm for all that. We have\n\nheard of the Mysians, a people whom we certainly cannot admit to be\n\nbetter than ourselves; and yet they inhabit numbers of large and\n\nprosperous cities in the king's own country without asking leave. The\n\nPisidians are an equally good instance, or the Lycaonians. We have\n\nseen with our own eyes how they fare: seizing fortresses down in the\n\nplains, and reaping the fruits of these men's territory. As to us, I\n\ngo so far as to assert, we ought never to have let it be seen that we\n\nwere bent on getting home: at any rate, not so soon; we should have\n\nbegun stocking and furnishing ourselves, as if we fully meant to\n\nsettle down for life somewhere or other hereabouts. I am sure that the\n\nking would be thrice glad to give the Mysians as many guides as they\n", "like, or as many hostages as they care to demand, in return for a safe\n\nconduct out of his country; he would make carriage roads for them, and\n\nif they preferred to take their departure in coaches and four, he\n\nwould not say them nay. So too, I am sure, he would be only too glad\n\nto accommodate us in the same way, if he saw us preparing to settle\n\ndown here. But, perhaps, it is just as well that we did not stop; for\n\nI fear, if once we learn to live in idleness and to batten in luxury\n\nand dalliance with these tall and handsome Median and Persian women\n\nand maidens, we shall be like the Lotus-eaters (5), and forget the road\n\nhome altogether.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (5) See \"Odyssey,\" ix. 94, \"ever feeding on the Lotus and forgetful of\n\n    returning.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"It seems to me that it is only right, in the first instance, to make\n\nan effort to return to Hellas and to revisit our hearths and homes, if\n\nonly to prove to other Hellenes that it is their own faults if they\n\nare poor and needy (6), seeing it is in their power to give to those     26\n\nnow living a pauper life at home a free passage hither, and convert\n\nthem into well-to-do burghers at once. Now, sirs, is it not clear that\n\nall these good things belong to whoever has strength to hold them?\n\n<br/><br/>\n (6) Here seems to be the germ--unless, indeed, the thought had been\n\n    conceived above--here at any rate the first conscious expression\n\n    of the colonisation scheme, of which we shall hear more below, in\n\n    reference to Cotyora; the Phasis; Calpe. It appears again fifty\n\n    years later in the author's pamphlet \"On Revenues,\" chapters i.\n\n    and vi. For the special evils of the fourth century B.C., and the\n\n    growth of pauperism between B.C. 401 and 338, see Jebb, \"Attic\n\n    Orators,\" vol i. p. 17.\n", "<br/><br/>\n\"Let us look another matter in the face. How are we to march most\n\nsafely? or where blows are needed, how are we to fight to the best\n\nadvantage? That is the question.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"The first thing which I recommend is to burn the wagons we have got,\n\nso that we may be free to march wherever the army needs, and not,\n\npractically, make our baggage train our general. And, next, we should\n\nthrow our tents into the bonfire also: for these again are only a\n\ntrouble to carry, and do not contribute one grain of good either for\n\nfighting or getting provisions. Further, let us get rid of all\n\nsuperfluous baggage, save only what we require for the sake of war, or\n\nmeat and drink, so that as many of us as possible may be under arms,\n\nand as few as possible doing porterage. I need not remind you that, in\n\ncase of defeat, the owners' goods are not their own; but if we master\n\nour foes, we will make them our baggage bearers.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"It only rests for me to name the one thing which I look upon as the\n\ngreatest of all. You see, the enemy did not dare to bring war to bear\n\nupon us until they had first seized our generals; they felt that\n\nwhilst our rulers were there, and we obeyed them, they were no match\n\nfor us in war; but having got hold of them, they fully expected that\n\nthe consequent confusion and anarchy would prove fatal to us. What\n\nfollows? This: Officers and leaders ought to be more vigilant ever\n\nthan their predecessors; subordinates still more orderly and obedient\n\nto those in command now than even they were to those who are gone. And\n\nyou should pass a resolution that, in case of insubordination, any one  31\n\nwho stands by is to aid the officer in chastising the offender. So the\n\nenemy will be mightily deceived; for on this day they will behold ten\n\nthousand Clearchuses instead of one, who will not suffer one man to\n", "play the coward. And now it is high time I brought my remarks to an\n\nend, for may be the enemy will be here anon. Let those who are in\n\nfavour of these proposals confirm them with all speed, that they may\n\nbe realised in fact; or if any other course seem better, let not any\n\none, even though he be a private soldier, shrink from proposing it.\n\nOur common safety is our common need.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nAfter this Cheirisophus spoke. He said: \"If there is anything else to\n\nbe done, beyond what Xenophon has mentioned, we shall be able to carry\n\nit out presently; but with regard to what he has already proposed, it\n\nseems to me the best course to vote upon the matters at once. Those\n\nwho are in favour of Xenophon's proposals, hold up their hands.\" They\n\nall held them up. Xenophon rose again and said: \"Listen, sirs, while I\n\ntell you what I think we have need of besides. It is clear that we\n\nmust march where we can get provisions. Now, I am told there are some\n\nsplendid villages not more than two miles and a half distant. I should\n\nnot be surprised, then, if the enemy were to hang on our heels and dog\n\nus as we retire, like cowardly curs which rush out at the passer-by\n\nand bite him if they can, but when you turn upon them they run away.\n\nSuch will be their tactics, I take it. It may be safer, then, to march\n\nin a hollow square, so as to place the baggage animals and our mob of\n\nsutlers in greater security. It will save time to make the\n\nappointments at once, and to settle who leads the square and directs\n\nthe vanguard; who will take command of the two flanks, and who of the\n\nrearguard; so that, when the enemy appears, we shall not need to\n\ndeliberate, but can at once set in motion the machinery in existence.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"If any one has any better plan, we need not adopt mine; but if not,\n\nsuppose Cheirisophus takes the lead, as he is a Lacedaemonian, and the\n\ntwo eldest generals take in charge the two wings respectively, whilst\n", "Timasion and I, the two youngest, will for the present guard the rear.  37\n\nFor the rest, we can but make experiment of this arrangement, and\n\nalter it with deliberation, as from time to time any improvement\n\nsuggests itself. If any one has a better plan to propose, let him do\n\nso.\"... No dissentient voice was heard. Accordingly he said: \"Those\n\nin favour of this resolution, hold up their hands.\" The resolution was\n\ncarried. \"And now,\" said he, \"it would be well to separate and carry\n\nout what we have decreed. If any of you has set his heart on seeing\n\nhis friends again, let him remember to prove himself a man; there is\n\nno other way to achieve his heart's wish. Or is mere living an object\n\nwith any of you, strive to conquer; if to slay is the privilege of\n\nvictory, to die is the doom of the defeated. Or perhaps to gain money\n\nand wealth is your ambition, strive again for mastery; have not\n\nconquerors the double gain of keeping what is their own, whilst they\n\nseize the possessions of the vanquished?\"\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nIII\n\n<br/><br/>\nThe speaking was ended; they got up and retired; then they burnt the    1\n\nwagons and the tents, and after sharing with one another what each\n\nneeded out of their various superfluities, they threw the remnant into\n\nthe fire. Having done that, they proceeded to make their breakfasts.\n\nWhile they were breakfasting, Mithridates came with about thirty\n\nhorsemen, and summoning the generals within earshot, he thus addressed\n\nthem: \"Men of Hellas, I have been faithful to Cyrus, as you know well,\n\nand to-day I am your well-wisher; indeed, I am here spending my days\n\nin great fear: if then I could see any salutory course in prospect, I\n", "should be disposed to join you with all my retainers. Please inform\n\nme, then, as to what you propose, regarding me as your friend and\n\nwell-wisher, anxious only to pursue his march in your company.\" The\n\ngenerals held council, and resolved to give the following answer,\n\nCheirisophus acting as spokesman: \"We have resolved to make our way\n\nthrough the country, inflicting the least possible damage, provided we\n\nare allowed a free passage homewards; but if any one tries to hinder    3\n\nus, he will have to fight it out with us, and we shall bring all the\n\nforce in our power to bear.\" Thereat Mithridates set himself to prove\n\nto them that their deliverance, except with the king's good pleasure,\n\nwas hopeless. Then the meaning of his mission was plain. He was an\n\nagent in disguise; in fact, a relation of Tissaphernes was in\n\nattendance to keep a check on his loyalty. After that, the generals\n\nresolved that it would be better to proclaim open war, without truce\n\nor herald, as long as they were in the enemy's country; for they used\n\nto come and corrupt the soldiers, and they were even successful with\n\none officer--Nicarchus (1), an Arcadian, who went off in the night with\n\nabout twenty men.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) Can this be the same man whose escape is so graphically described\n\n    above?\n\n<br/><br/>\nAfter this, they breakfasted and crossed the river Zapatas, marching\n\nin regular order, with the beasts and mob of the army in the middle.\n\nThey had not advanced far on their route when Mithridates made his\n\nappearance again, with about a couple of hundred horsemen at his back,\n\nand bowmen and slingers twice as many, as nimble fellows as a man\n\nmight hope to see. He approached the Hellenes as if he were friendly;\n\nbut when they had got fairly to close quarters, all of a sudden some\n\nof them, whether mounted or on foot, began shooting with their bows\n", "and arrows, and another set with slings, wounding the men. The\n\nrearguard of the Hellenes suffered for a while severely without being\n\nable to retaliate, for the Cretans had a shorter range than the\n\nPersians, and at the same time, being light-armed troops, they lay\n\ncooped up within the ranks of the heavy infantry, while the javelin\n\nmen again did not shoot far enough to reach the enemy's slingers. This\n\nbeing so, Xenophon thought there was nothing for it but to charge, and\n\ncharge they did; some of the heavy and light infantry, who were\n\nguarding the rear, with him; but for all their charging they did not\n\ncatch a single man.\n\n<br/><br/>\nThe dearth of cavalry told against the Hellenes; nor were their\n\ninfantry able to overhaul the enemy's infantry, with the long start\n\nthey had, and considering the shortness of the race, for it was out of\n\nthe question to pursue them far from the main body of the army. On the  10\n\nother hand, the Asiatic cavalry, even while fleeing, poured volleys of\n\narrows behind their backs, and wounded the pursuers; while the\n\nHellenes must fall back fighting every step of the way they had\n\nmeasured in the pursuit; so that by the end of that day they had not\n\ngone much more than three miles; but in the late afternoon they\n\nreached the villages.\n\n<br/><br/>\nHere there was a return of the old despondency. Cheirisophus and the\n\neldest of the generals blamed Xenophon for leaving the main body to\n\ngive chase and endangering himself thereby, while he could not damage\n\nthe enemy one whit the more. Xenophon admitted that they were right in\n\nblaming him: no better proof of that was wanted than the result. \"The\n\nfact is,\" he added, \"I was driven to pursue; it was too trying to look\n\non and see our men suffer so badly, and be unable to retaliate.\n\nHowever, when we did charge, there is no denying the truth of what you\n", "say; we were not a whit more able to injure the enemy, while we had\n\nconsiderable difficulty in beating a retreat ourselves. Thank heaven\n\nthey did not come upon us in any great force, but were only a handful\n\nof men; so that the injury they did us was not large, as it might have\n\nbeen; and at least it has served to show us what we need. At present\n\nthe enemy shoot and sling beyond our range, so that our Cretan archers\n\nare no match for them; our hand-throwers cannot reach as far; and when\n\nwe pursue, it is not possible to push the pursuit to any great\n\ndistance from the main body, and within the short distance no\n\nfoot-soldier, however fleet of foot, could overtake another\n\nfoot-soldier who has a bow-shot the start of him. If, then, we are to\n\nexclude them from all possibility of injuring us as we march, we must\n\nget slingers as soon as possible and cavalry. I am told there are in\n\nthe army some Rhodians, most of whom, they say, know how to sling, and\n\ntheir missile will reach even twice as far as the Persian slings\n\n(which, on account of their being loaded with stones as big as one's\n\nfist, have a comparatively short range; but the Rhodians are skilled\n\nin the use of leaden bullets (2)). Suppose, then, we investigate and     18\n\nfind out first of all who among them possess slings, and for these\n\nslings offer the owner the money value; and to another, who will plait\n\nsome more, hand over the money price; and for a third, who will\n\nvolunteer to be enrolled as a slinger, invent some other sort of\n\nprivilege, I think we shall soon find people to come forward capable\n\nof helping us. There are horses in the army I know; some few with\n\nmyself, others belonging to Clearchus's stud, and a good many others\n\ncaptured from the enemy, used for carrying baggage. Let us take the\n\npick of these, supplying their places by ordinary baggage animals, and\n\nequipping the horses for cavalry. I should not wonder if our troopers\n\ngave some annoyance to these fugitives.\"\n\n<br/><br/>", " (2) These words sound to me like an author's note, parenthetically,\n\n    and perhaps inadvertently, inserted into the text. It is an\n\n    \"aside\" to the reader, which in a modern book would appear as a\n\n    footnote.\n\n<br/><br/>\nThese proposals were carried, and that night two hundred slingers were\n\nenrolled, and next day as many as fifty horse and horsemen passed\n\nmuster as duly qualified; buff jackets and cuirasses were provided for\n\nthem, and a commandant of cavalry appointed to command--Lycius, the\n\nson of Polystratus, by name, an Athenian.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nIV\n\n<br/><br/>\nThat day they remained inactive, but the next they rose earlier than    1\n\nusual, and set out betimes, for they had a ravine to cross, where they\n\nfeared the enemy might attack them in the act of crossing. When they\n\nwere across, Mithridates appeared again with one thousand horse, and\n\narchers and slingers to the number of four thousand. This whole body\n\nhe had got by request from Tissaphernes, and in return he undertook to\n\ndeliver up the Hellenes to Tissaphernes. He had grown contemptuous\n\nsince his late attack, when, with so small a detachment, he had done,\n\nas he thought, a good deal of mischief, without the slightest loss to\n\nhimself.\n\n<br/><br/>\nWhen the Hellenes were not only right across, but had got about a mile\n\nfrom the ravine, Mithridates also crossed with his forces. An order\n\nhad been passed down the lines, what light infantry and what heavy\n", "infantry were to take part in the pursuit; and the cavalry were\n\ninstructed to follow up the pursuit with confidence, as a considerable  3\n\nsupport was in their rear. So, when Mithridates had come up with them,\n\nand they were well within arrow and sling shot, the bugle sounded the\n\nsignal to the Hellenes; and immediately the detachment under orders\n\nrushed to close quarters, and the cavalry charged. There the enemy\n\npreferred not to wait, but fled towards the ravine. In this pursuit\n\nthe Asiatics lost several of their infantry killed, and of their\n\ncavalry as many as eighteen were taken prisoners in the ravine. As to\n\nthose who were slain the Hellenes, acting upon impulse, mutilated\n\ntheir bodies, by way of impressing their enemy with as frightful an\n\nimage as possible.\n\n<br/><br/>\nSo fared the foe and so fell back; but the Hellenes, continuing their\n\nmarch in safety for the rest of that day, reached the river Tigris.\n\nHere they came upon a large deserted city, the name of which was\n\nLarissa (1): a place inhabited by the Medes in days of old; the breadth\n\nof its walls was twenty-five feet, and the height of them a hundred,\n\nand the circuit of the whole two parasangs. It was built of\n\nclay-bricks, supported on a stone basis twenty feet high. This city\n\nthe king of the Persians (2) besieged, what time the Persians strove to\n\nsnatch their empire from the Medes, but he could in no wise take it;\n\nthen a cloud hid the face of the sun and blotted out the light\n\nthereof, until the inhabitants were gone out of the city, and so it\n\nwas taken. By the side of this city there was a stone pyramid in\n\nbreadth a hundred feet, and in height two hundred feet; in it were\n\nmany of the barbarians who had fled for refuge from the neighbouring\n\nvillages.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) Larissa, on the side of the modern Nimrud (the south-west corner,\n", "    as is commonly supposed, of Nineveh). The name is said to mean\n\n    \"citadel,\" and is given to various Greek cities (of which several\n\n    occur in Xenophon).\n\n<br/><br/>\n (2) I.e. Cyrus the Great.\n\n<br/><br/>\nFrom this place they marched one stage of six parasangs to a great\n\ndeserted fortress  (which lay over against the city), and the name of\n\nthat city was Mespila (3). The Medes once dwelt in it. The basement was  10\n\nmade of polished stone full of shells; fifty feet was the breadth of\n\nit, and fifty feet the height; and on this basement was reared a wall\n\nof brick, the breadth whereof was fifty feet and the height thereof\n\nfour hundred; and the circuit of the wall was six parasangs. Hither,\n\nas the story goes, Medea (4), the king's wife, betook herself in flight\n\nwhat time the Medes lost their empire at the hands of the Persians. To\n\nthis city also the king of the Pesians laid siege, but could not take\n\nit either by length of days or strength of hand. But Zeus sent\n\namazement on the inhabitants thereof, and so it was taken.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (3) Opposite Mosul, the north-west portion of the ancient Nineveh,\n\n    about eighteen miles above Larissa. The circuit of Nineveh is said\n\n    to have been about fifty-six miles. It was overthrown by Cyrus in\n\n    B.C. 558.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (4) The wife of Astyages, the last king of Media. Some think \"the wall\n\n    of Media\" should be \"Medea's wall,\" constructed in the period of\n\n    Queen Nitocris, B.C. 560.\n\n<br/><br/>\nFrom this place they marched one stage--four parasangs. But, while\n\nstill on this stage, Tissaphernes made his appearance. He had with him\n", "his own cavalry and a force belonging to Orontas, who had the king's\n\ndaughter to wife; and there were, moreover, with them the Asiatics\n\nwhom Cyrus had taken with him on his march up; together with those\n\nwhom the king's brother had brought as a reinforcement to the king;\n\nbesides those whom Tissaphernes himself had received as a gift from\n\nthe king, so that the armament appeared to be very great. When they\n\nwere close, he halted some of his regiments at the rear and wheeled\n\nothers into position on either flank, but hesitated to attack, having\n\nno mind apparently to run any risks, and contenting himself with an\n\norder to his slingers to sling and his archers to shoot. But when the\n\nRhodian slingers and the bowmen (5), posted at intervals, retaliated,\n\nand every shot told (for with the utmost pains to miss it would have\n\nbeen hard to do so under the circumstanecs), then Tissaphernes with\n\nall speed retired out of range, the other regiments following suit;\n\nand for the rest of the day the one party advanced and the other\n\nfollowed. But now the Asiatics had ceased to be dangerous with their\n\nsharpshooting. For the Rhodians could reach further than the Persian    16\n\nslingers, or, indeed, than most of the bowmen. The Persian bows are of\n\ngreat size, so that the Cretans found the arrows which were picked up\n\nserviceable, and persevered in using their enemies' arrows, and\n\npractised shooting with them, letting them fly upwards to a great\n\nheight (6). There were also plenty of bowstrings found in the\n\nvillages--and lead, which they turned to account for their slings. As\n\na result of this day, then, the Hellenes chancing upon some villages\n\nhad no sooner encamped than the barbarians fell back, having had\n\ndistinctly the worst of it in the skirmishing.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (5) The best MSS read {Skuthai}, Scythians; if this is correct, it is\n\n    only the technical name for \"archers.\" Cf. Arrian, \"Tact.\" ii. 13.\n\n    The police at Athens were technically so called, as being composed\n", "    of Scythian slaves. Cf. Aristoph. \"Thesm.\" 1017.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (6) I.e., in practising, in order to get the maximum range they let\n\n    fly the arrows, not horizontally, but up into the air. Sir W.\n\n    Raleigh (Hist. of the World, III. x. 8) says that Xenophon\n\n    \"trained his archers to short compass, who had been accustomed to\n\n    the point blank,\" but this is surely not Xenophon's meaning.\n\n<br/><br/>\nThe next day was a day of inaction: they halted and took in supplies,\n\nas there was much corn in the villages; but on the day following, the\n\nmarch was continued through the plain (of the Tigris), and\n\nTissaphernes still hung on their skirts with his skirmishers. And now\n\nit was that the Hellenes discovered the defect of marching in a square\n\nwith an enemy following. As a matter of necessity, whenever the wings\n\nof an army so disposed draw together, either where a road narrows, or\n\nhills close in, or a bridge has to be crossed, the heavy infantry\n\ncannot help being squeezed out of their ranks, and march with\n\ndifficulty, partly from actual pressure, and partly from the general\n\nconfusion that ensues. Or, supposing the wings are again extended, the\n\ntroops have hardly recovered from their former distress before they\n\nare pulled asunder, and there is a wide space between the wings, and\n\nthe men concerned lose confidence in themselves, especially with an\n\nenemy close behind. What happened, when a bridge had to be crossed or\n\nother passage effected, was, that each unit of the force pressed on in\n\nanxiety to get over first, and at these moments it was easy for the\n\nenemy to make an attack. The generals accordingly, having recognised\n\nthe defect, set about curing it. To do so, they made six lochi, or\n\ndivisions of a hundred men apiece, each of which had its own set of\n\ncaptains and under-officers in command of half and quarter companies.   21\n\nIt was the duty of these new companies, during a march, whenever the\n", "flanks needed to close in, to fall back to the rear, so as to\n\ndisencumber the wings. This they did by wheeling clear of them. When\n\nthe sides of the oblong again extended, they filled up the\n\ninterstices, if the gap were narrow, by columns of companies, if\n\nbroader, by columns of half-companies, or, if broader still, by\n\ncolumns of quarter-companies, so that the space between was always\n\nfilled up. If again it were necessary to effect a passage by bridge or\n\notherwise, there was no confusion, the several companies crossing in\n\nturns; or, if the occasion arose to form in line of battle, these\n\ncompanies came up to the front and fell in (7).\n\n<br/><br/>\n (7) In the passage above I have translated {lokhoi} companies, and, as\n\n    usual, {lokhagoi} captains. The half company is technically called\n\n    a pentecostys, and a quarter company an enomoty, and the officers\n\n    in charge of them respectively penteconter and enomotarch. These\n\n    would be equivalent nearly to our subalterns and sergeants, and in\n\n    the evolutions described would act as guides and markers in charge\n\n    of their sections. Grote thinks there were six companies formed on\n\n    each flank--twelve in all. See \"Hist. of Greece,\" vol. ix. p. 123,\n\n    note (1st ed.)\n\n<br/><br/>\nIn this way they advanced four stages, but ere the fifth was\n\ncompleted, they came in sight of a palace of some sort, with villages\n\nclustered round it; they could further see that the road leading to\n\nthis place pursued its course over high undulating hillocks, the spur\n\nof the mountain range, under which lay the village. These knolls were\n\na welcome sight to the Hellenes, naturally enough, as the enemy were\n\ncavalry. However, when they had issued from the plain and ascended the\n\nfirst crest, and were in the act of descending it so as to mount the\n\nnext, at this juncture the barbarians came upon them. From the high\n", "ground down the sheer steep they poured a volley of darts,\n\nslingstones, and arrows, which they discharged \"under the lash (8),\"\n\nwounding many, until they got the better of the Hellenic light troops,\n\nand drove them for shelter behind the heavy infantry, so that this day\n\nthat arm was altogether useless, huddling in the mob of sutlers, both   26\n\nslingers and archers alike.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (8) I.e. the Persian leaders were seen flogging their men to the\n\n    attack. Cf. Herod. vii. 22. 3.\n\n<br/><br/>\nBut when the Hellenes, being so pressed, made an attempt to pursue,\n\nthey could barely scale to the summit, being heavy-armed troops, while\n\nthe enemy as lightly sprung away; and they suffered similarly in\n\nretiring to join the rest of the army. And then, on the second hill,\n\nthe whole had to be gone through again; so that when it came to the\n\nthird hillock, they determined not to move the main body of troops\n\nfrom their position until they had brought up a squadron of light\n\ninfantry from the right flank of the square to a point on the mountain\n\nrange. When this detachment were once posted above their pursuers, the\n\nlatter desisted from attacking the main body in its descent, for fear\n\nof being cut off and finding themselves between two assailants. Thus\n\nthe rest of the day they moved on in two divisions: one set keeping to\n\nthe road by the hillocks, the other marching parallel on the higher\n\nlevel along the mountains; and thus they reached the villages and\n\nappointed eight surgeons to attend to the many wounded.\n\n<br/><br/>\nHere they halted three days for the sake of the wounded chiefly, while\n\na further inducement was the plentiful supply of provisions which they\n\nfound, wheat and wine, and large stores of barley laid up for horses.\n\nThese supplies had been collected by the ruling satrap of the country.\n", "On the fourth day they began their descent into the plain; but when\n\nTissaphernes overtook them, necessity taught them to camp in the first\n\nvillage they caught sight of, and give over the attempt of marching\n\nand fighting simultaneously, as so many were hors de combat, being\n\neither on the list of wounded themselves, or else engaged in carrying\n\nthe wounded, or laden with the heavy arms of those so occupied. But\n\nwhen they were once encamped, and the barbarians, advancing upon the\n\nvillage, made an attempt to harass them with their sharp-shooters, the\n\nsuperiority of the Hellenes was pronounced. To sustain a running fight\n\nwith an enemy constantly attacking was one thing; to keep him at arm's\n\nlength from a fixed base of action another: and the difference was\n\nmuch in their favour.\n\n<br/><br/>\nBut when it was late afternoon, the time had come for the enemy to      34\n\nwithdraw, since the habit of the barbarian was never to encamp within\n\nseven or eight miles of the Hellenic camp. This he did in apprehension\n\nof a night attack, for a Persian army is good for nothing at night.\n\nTheir horses are haltered, and, as a rule, hobbled as well, to prevent\n\ntheir escaping, as they might if loose; so that, if any alarm occurs,\n\nthe trooper has to saddle and bridle his horse, and then he must put\n\non his own cuirass, and then mount--all which performances are\n\ndifficult at night and in the midst of confusion. For this reason they\n\nalways encamped at a distance from the Hellenes.\n\n<br/><br/>\nWhen the Hellenes perceived that they were preparing to retire, and\n\nthat the order was being given, the herald's cry, \"Pack up for\n\nstarting,\" might be heard before the enemy was fairly out of earshot.\n\nFor a while the Asiatics paused, as if unwilling to be gone; but as\n\nnight closed in, off they went, for it did not suit their notions of\n\nexpediency to set off on a march and arrive by night. And now, when\n", "the Hellenes saw that they were really and clearly gone, they too\n\nbroke up their camp and pursued their march till they had traversed\n\nseven and a half miles. Thus the distance between the two armies grew\n\nto be so great, that the next day the enemy did not appear at all, nor\n\nyet on the third day; but on the fourth the barbarians had pushed on\n\nby a forced night march and occupied a commanding position on the\n\nright, where the Hellenes had to pass. It was a narrow mountain\n\nspur (9) overhanging the descent into the plain.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (9) Lit. \"a mere nail tip.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nBut when Cheirisophus saw that this ridge was occupied, he summoned\n\nXenophon from the rear, bidding him at the same time to bring up\n\npeltasts to the front. That Xenophon hesitated to do, for Tissaphernes\n\nand his whole army were coming up and were well within sight.\n\nGalloping up to the front himself, he asked: \"Why do you summon me?\"\n\nThe other answered him: \"The reason is plain; look yonder; this crest\n\nwhich overhangs our descent has been occupied. There is no passing,     39\n\nuntil we have dislodged these fellows; why have you not brought up the\n\nlight infantry?\" Xenophon explained: he had not thought it desirable\n\nto leave the rear unprotected, with an enemy appearing in the field of\n\nview. \"However, it is time,\" he added, \"to decide how we are to\n\ndislodge these fellows from the crest.\" At this moment his eye fell on\n\nthe peak of the mountain, rising immediately above their army, and he\n\ncould see an approach leading from it to the crest in question where\n\nthe enemy lay. He exclaimed: \"The best thing we can do, Cheirisophus,\n\nis to make a dash at the height itself, and with what speed we may. If\n\nwe take it, the party in command of the road will never be able to\n\nstop. If you like, stay in command of the army, and I will go; or, if\n\nyou prefer, do you go to the mountain, and I will stay here.\"--\"I\n", "leave it to you,\" Cheirisophus answered, \"to choose which you like\n\nbest.\" Xenophon remarking, \"I am the younger,\" elected to go; but he\n\nstipulated for a detachment from the front to accompany him, since it\n\nwas a long way to fetch up troops from the rear. Accordingly\n\nCheirisophus furnished him with the light infantry from the front,\n\nreoccupying their place by those from the centre. He also gave him, to\n\nform part of the detachment, the three hundred of the picked corps (10)\n\nunder his own command at the head of the square.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (10) Some think that these three hundred are three of the detached\n\n    companies described above; others, that they were a picked corps\n\n    in attendance on the commander-in-chief.\n\n<br/><br/>\nThey set out from the low ground with all the haste imaginable. But\n\nthe enemy in position on the crest no sooner perceived their advance\n\nupon the summit of the pass than they themselves set off full tilt in\n\na rival race for the summit too. Hoarse were the shouts of the\n\nHellenic troops as the men cheered their companions forwards, and\n\nhoarse the answering shouts from the troops of Tissaphernes, urging on\n\ntheirs. Xenophon, mounted on his charger, rode beside his men, and\n\nroused their ardour the while. \"Now for it, brave sirs; bethink you\n\nthat this race is for Hellas!--now or never!--to find your boys, your\n\nwives; one small effort, and the rest of the march we shall pursue in\n\npeace, without ever a blow to strike; now for it.\" But Soteridas the\n\nSicyonian said: \"We are not on equal terms, Xenophon; you are mounted   47\n\non a horse; I can hardly get along with my shield to carry;\" and he,\n\non hearing the reproach, leapt from his horse. In another instant he\n\nhad pushed Soteridas from the ranks, snatched from him his shield, and\n\nbegun marching as quickly as he might under the circumstances, having\n\nhis horseman's cuirass to carry as well, so that he was sore pressed;\n", "but he continued to cheer on the troops: exhorting those in front to\n\nlead on and the men toiling behind to follow up (11). Soteridas was not\n\nspared by the rest of the men. They gave him blows, they pelted him,\n\nthey showered him with abuse, till they compelled him to take back his\n\nshield and march on; and the other, remounting, led them on horseback\n\nas long as the footing held; but when the ground became too steep, he\n\nleft his horse and pressed forward on foot, and so they found\n\nthemselves on the summit before the enemy.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (11) Some MSS. \"and the men behind to pass him by, as he could but ill\n\n    keep up the pace.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nV\n\n<br/><br/>\nThere and then the barbarians turned and fled as best they might, and   1\n\nthe Hellenes held the summit, while the troops with Tissaphernes and\n\nAriaeus turned aside and disappeared by another road. The main body\n\nwith Cheirisophus made its way down into the plain and encamped in a\n\nvillage filled with good things of divers sorts. Nor did this village\n\nstand alone; there were others not a few in this plain of the Tigris\n\nequally overflowing with plenty. It was now afternoon; and all of a\n\nsudden the enemy came in sight on the plain, and succeeded in cutting\n\ndown some of the Hellenes belonging to parties who were scattered over\n\nthe flat land in quest of spoil. Indeed, many herds of cattle had been\n\ncaught whilst being conveyed across to the other side of the river.\n\nAnd now Tissaphernes and his troops made an attempt to burn the\n\nvillages, and some of the Hellenes were disposed to take the matter\n", "deeply to heart, being apprehensive that they might not know where to\n\nget provisions if the enemy burnt the villages.\n\n<br/><br/>\nCheirisophus and his men were returning from their sally of defence\n\nwhen Xenophon and his party descended, and the latter rode along the    4\n\nranks as the rescuing party came up, and greeted them thus: \"Do you\n\nnot see, men of Hellas, they admit that the country is now ours; what\n\nthey stipulated against our doing when they made the treaty, viz. that\n\nwe were not to fire the king's country, they are now themselves\n\ndoing--setting fire to it as if it were not their own. But we will be\n\neven with them; if they leave provisions for themselves anywhere,\n\nthere also shall they see us marching;\" and, turning to Cheirisophus,\n\nhe added: \"But it strikes me, we should sally forth against these\n\nincendiaries and protect our country.\" Cheirisophus retorted: \"That is\n\nnot quite my view; I say, let us do a little burning ourselves, and\n\nthey will cease all the quicker.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nWhen they had got back to the villages, while the rest were busy about\n\nprovisions, the generals and officers met: and here there was deep\n\ndespondency. For on the one side were exceedingly high mountains; on\n\nthe other a river of such depth that they failed to reach the bottom\n\nwith their spears. In the midst of their perplexities, a Rhodian came\n\nup with a proposal, as follows: \"I am ready, sirs to carry you across,\n\nfour thousand heavy infantry at a time; if you will furnish me with\n\nwhat I need and give me a talent into the bargain for my pains.\" When\n\nasked, \"What shall you need?\" he replied: \"Two thousand wine-skins. I\n\nsee there are plenty of sheep and goats and asses. They have only to\n\nbe flayed, and their skins inflated, and they will readily give us a\n\npassage. I shall want also the straps which you use for the baggage\n\nanimals. With these I shall couple the skins to one another; then I\n", "shall moor each skin by attaching stones and letting them down like\n\nanchors into the water. Then I shall carry them across, and when I\n\nhave fastened the links at both ends, I shall place layers of wood on\n\nthem and a coating of earth on the top of that. You will see in a\n\nminute that there's no danger of your drowning, for every skin will be\n\nable to support a couple of men without sinking, and the wood and\n\nearth will prevent your slipping off.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nThe generals thought it a pretty invention enough, but its realisation\n\nimpracticable, for on the other side were masses of cavalry posted and\n\nready to bar the passage; who, to begin with, would not suffer the      12\n\nfirst detachment of crossers to carry out any item of the programme.\n\n<br/><br/>\nUnder these circumstances, the next day they turned right about face,\n\nand began retracing their steps in the direction of Babylon to the\n\nunburnt villages, having previously set fire to those they left, so\n\nthat the enemy did not ride up to them, but stood and stared, all\n\nagape to see in what direction the Hellenes would betake themselves\n\nand what they were minded to do. Here, again, while the rest of the\n\nsoldiers were busy about provisions, the generals and officers met in\n\ncouncil, and after collecting the prisoners together, submitted them\n\nto a cross-examination touching the whole country round, the names,\n\nand so forth, of each district.\n\n<br/><br/>\nThe prisoners informed them that the regions south, through which they\n\nhad come, belonged to the district towards Babylon and Media; the road\n\neast led to Susa and Ecbatana, where the king is said to spend summer\n\nand spring; crossing the river, the road west led to Lydia and Ionia;\n\nand the part through the mountains facing towards the Great Bear, led,\n\nthey said, to the Carduchians (1). They were a people, so said the\n", "prisoners, dwelling up on the hills, addicted to war, and not subject\n\nto the king; so much so that once, when a royal army one hundred and\n\ntwenty thousand strong had invaded them, not a man came back, owing to\n\nthe intricacies of the country. Occasionally, however, they made truce\n\nor treaty with the satrap in the plain, and, for the nonce, there\n\nwould be intercourse: \"they will come in and out amongst us,\" \"and we\n\nwill go in and out amongst them,\" said the captives.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) See Dr. Kiepert, \"Man. Anc. Geog.\" (Mr. G. A. Macmillan) iv. 47.\n\n    The Karduchians or Kurds belong by speech to the Iranian stock,\n\n    forming in fact their farthest outpost to the west, little given\n\n    to agriculture, but chiefly to the breeding of cattle. Their name,\n\n    pronounced Kardu by the ancient Syrians and Assyrians, Kordu by\n\n    the Armenians (plural Kordukh), first appears in its narrower\n\n    sense in western literature in the pages of the eye-witness\n\n    Xenophon as {Kardoukhoi}. Later writers knew of a small kingdom\n\n    here at the time of the Roman occupation, ruled by native princes,\n\n    who after Tigranes II (about 80 B.C.) recognised the overlordship\n\n    of the Armenian king. Later it became a province of the Sassanid\n\n    kingdom, and as such was in 297 A.D. handed over among the\n\n    regiones transtigritanae to the Roman empire, but in 364 was again\n\n    ceded to Persia.\n\n<br/><br/>\nAfter hearing these statements, the generals seated apart those who     17\n\nclaimed to have any special knowledge of the country in any direction;\n\nthey put them to sit apart without making it clear which particular\n\nroute they intended to take. Finally the resolution to which they came\n\nwas that they must force a passage through the hills into the\n\nterritory of the Kurds; since, according to what their informants told\n\nthem, when they had once passed these, they would find themselves in\n", "Armenia--the rich and large territory governed by Orontas; and from\n\nArmenia, it would be easy to proceed in any direction whatever.\n\nThereupon they offered sacrifice, so as to be ready to start on the\n\nmarch as soon as the right moment appeared to have arrived. Their\n\nchief fear was that the high pass over the mountains must be occupied\n\nin advance: and a general order was issued, that after supper every\n\none should get his kit together for starting, and repose, in readiness\n\nto follow as soon as the word of command was given.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nBOOK IV\n\n<br/><br/>\n (In the preceding portion of the narrative a full account is\n\ngiven of the incidents of the march up to the battle, and of\n\nthe occurrences after the battle during the truce which was\n\nestablished between the king and the Hellenes, who marched up\n\nwith Cyrus, and thirdly, of the fighting to which the Hellenes\n\nwere exposed, after the king and Tissaphernes had broken the\n\ntreaty, while a Persian army hung on their rear. Having\n\nfinally reached a point at which the Tigris was absolutely\n\nimpassable owing to its depth and breadth, while there was no\n\npassage along the bank itself, and the Carduchian hills hung\n\nsheer over the river, the generals took the resolution above\n\nmentioned of forcing a passage through the mountains. The\n\ninformation derived from the prisoners taken along the way led\n\nthem to believe that once across the Carduchian mountains they\n\nwould have the choice either of crossing the Tigris--if they\n", "liked to do so--at its sources in Armenia, or of going round\n\nthem, if so they preferred. Report further said that the\n\nsources of the Euphrates also were not far from those of the\n\nTigris, and this is actually the case. The advance into the\n\ncountry of the Carduchians was conducted with a view partly to\n\nsecrecy, and partly to speed, so as to effect their entry\n\nbefore the enemy could occupy the passes.)\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nI\n\n<br/><br/>\nIt was now about the last watch, and enough of the night remained to    1\n\nallow them to cross the valley under cover of darkness; when, at the\n\nword of command, they rose and set off on their march, reaching the\n\nmountains at daybreak. At this stage of the march Cheirisophus, at the\n\nhead of his own division, with the whole of the light troops, led the\n\nvan, while Xenophon followed behind with the heavy infantry of the\n\nrearguard, but without any light troops, since there seemed to be no\n\ndanger of pursuit or attack from the rear, while they were making\n\ntheir way up hill. Cheirisophus reached the summit without any of the   6\n\nenemy perceiving him. Then he led on slowly, and the rest of the army\n\nfollowed, wave upon wave, cresting the summit and descending into the\n\nvillages which nestled in the hollows and recesses of the hills.\n\n<br/><br/>\nThereupon the Carduchians abandoned their dwelling places, and with\n\ntheir wives and children fled to the mountains; so there was plenty of\n\nprovisions to be got for the mere trouble of taking, and the\n\nhomesteads too were well supplied with a copious store of bronze\n", "vessels and utensils which the Hellenes kept their hands off,\n\nabstaining at the same time from all pursuit of the folk themselves,\n\ngently handling them, in hopes that the Carduchians might be willing\n\nto give them friendly passage through their country, since they too\n\nwere enemies of the king: only they helped themselves to such\n\nprovisions as fell in their way, which indeed was a sheer necessity.\n\nBut the Carduchians neither gave ear, when they called to them, nor\n\nshowed any other friendly sign; and now, as the last of the Hellenes\n\ndescended into the villages from the pass, they were already in the\n\ndark, since, owing to the narrowness of the road, the whole day had\n\nbeen spent in the ascent and descent. At that instant a party of the\n\nCarduchians, who had collected, made an attack on the hindmost men,\n\nkilling some and wounding others with stones and arrows--though it was\n\nquite a small body who attacked. The fact was, the approach of the\n\nHellenic army had taken them by surprise; if, however, they had\n\nmustered in larger force at this time, the chances are that a large\n\nportion of the army would have been annihilated. As it was, they got\n\ninto quarters, and bivouacked in the villages that night, while the\n\nCarduchians kept many watch-fires blazing in a circle on the\n\nmountains, and kept each other in sight all round.\n\n<br/><br/>\nBut with the dawn the generals and officers of the Hellenes met and\n\nresolved to proceed, taking only the necessary number of stout baggage\n\nanimals, and leaving the weaklings behind. They resolved further to\n\nlet go free all the lately-captured slaves in the host; for the pace\n\nof the march was necessarily rendered slow by the quantity of animals\n\nand prisoners, and the number of non-combatants in attendance on these  13\n\nwas excessive, while, with such a crowd of human beings to satisfy,\n\ntwice the amount of provisions had to be procured and carried. These\n\nresolutions passed, they caused a proclamation by herald to be made\n", "for their enforcement.\n\n<br/><br/>\nWhen they had breakfasted and the march recommenced, the generals\n\nplanted themselves a little to one side in a narrow place, and when\n\nthey found any of the aforesaid slaves or other property still\n\nretained, they confiscated them. The soldiers yielded obedience,\n\nexcept where some smuggler, prompted by desire of a good-looking boy\n\nor woman, managed to make off with his prize. During this day they\n\ncontrived to get along after a fashion, now fighting and now resting.\n\nBut on the next day they were visited by a great storm, in spite of\n\nwhich they were obliged to continue the march, owing to insufficiency\n\nof provisions. Cheirisophus was as usual leading in front, while\n\nXenophon headed the rearguard, when the enemy began a violent and\n\nsustained attack. At one narrow place after another they came up quite\n\nclose, pouring in volleys of arrows and slingstones, so that the\n\nHellenes had no choice but to make sallies in pursuit and then again\n\nrecoil, making but very little progress. Over and over again Xenophon\n\nwould send an order to the front to slacken pace, when the enemy were\n\npressing their attack severely. As a rule, when the word was so passed\n\nup, Cheirisophus slackened; but sometimes instead of slackening,\n\nCheirisophus quickened, sending down a counter-order to the rear to\n\nfollow on quickly. It was clear that there was something or other\n\nhappening, but there was no time to go to the front and discover the\n\ncause of the hurry. Under the circumstances the march, at any rate in\n\nthe rear, became very like a rout, and here a brave man lost his life,\n\nCleonymus the Laconian, shot with an arrow in the ribs right through\n\nshield and corselet, as also Basias, an Arcadian, shot clean through\n\nthe head.\n\n<br/><br/>\nAs soon as they reached a halting-place, Xenophon, without more ado,\n", "came up to Cheirisophus, and took him to task for not having waited,\n\n\"whereby,\" he said, \"we were forced to fight and flee at the same       19\n\nmoment; and now it has cost us the lives of two fine fellows; they are\n\ndead, and we were not able to pick up their bodies or bury them.\"\n\nCheirisophus answered: \"Look up there,\" pointing as he spoke to the\n\nmountain, \"do you see how inaccessible it all is? only this one road,\n\nwhich you see, going straight up, and on it all that crowd of men who\n\nhave seized and are guarding the single exit. That is why I hastened\n\non, and why I could not wait for you, hoping to be beforehand with\n\nthem yonder in seizing the pass: the guides we have got say there is\n\nno other way.\" And Xenophon replied: \"But I have got two prisoners\n\nalso; the enemy annoyed us so much that we laid an ambuscade for them,\n\nwhich also gave us time to recover our breaths; we killed some of\n\nthem, and did our best to catch one or two alive--for this very\n\nreason--that we might have guides who knew the country, to depend\n\nupon.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nThe two were brought up at once and questioned separately: \"Did they\n\nknow of any other road than the one visible?\" The first said no; and\n\nin spite of all sorts of terrors applied to extract a better\n\nanswer--\"no,\" he persisted. When nothing could be got out of him, he\n\nwas killed before the eyes of his fellow. This latter then explained:\n\n\"Yonder man said, he did not know, because he has got a daughter\n\nmarried to a husband in those parts. I can take you,\" he added, \"by a\n\ngood road, practicable even for beasts.\" And when asked whether there\n\nwas any point on it difficult to pass, he replied that there was a col\n\nwhich it would be impossible to pass unless it were occupied in\n\nadvance.\n\n<br/><br/>\nThen it was resolved to summon the officers of the light infantry and\n", "some of those of the heavy infantry, and to acquaint them with the\n\nstate of affairs, and ask them whether any of them were minded to\n\ndistinguish themselves, and would step forward as volunteers on an\n\nexpedition. Two or three heavy infantry soldiers stepped forward at\n\nonce--two Arcadians, Aristonymus of Methydrium, and Agasias of\n\nStymphalus--and in emulation of these, a third, also an Arcadian,\n\nCallimachus from Parrhasia, who said he was ready to go, and would get\n\nvolunteers from the whole army to join him. \"I know,\" he added, \"there  27\n\nwill be no lack of youngsters to follow where I lead.\" After that they\n\nasked, \"Were there any captains of light infantry willing to accompany\n\nthe expedition?\" Aristeas, a Chian, who on several occasions proved\n\nhis usefulness to the army on such service, volunteered.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nII\n\n<br/><br/>\nIt was already late afternoon, when they ordered the storming party to  1\n\ntake a snatch of food and set off; then they bound the guide and\n\nhanded him over to them. The agreement was, that if they succeeded in\n\ntaking the summit they were to guard the position that night, and at\n\ndaybreak to give a signal by bugle. At this signal the party on the\n\nsummit were to attack the enemy in occupation of the visible pass,\n\nwhile the generals with the main body would bring up their succours;\n\nmaking their way up with what speed they might. With this\n\nunderstanding, off they set, two thousand strong; and there was a\n\nheavy downpour of rain, but Xenophon, with his rearguard, began\n\nadvancing to the visible pass, so that the enemy might fix his\n\nattention on this road, and the party creeping round might, as much as\n", "possible, elude observation. Now when the rearguard, so advancing, had\n\nreached a ravine which they must cross in order to strike up the\n\nsteep, at that instant the barbarians began rolling down great\n\nboulders, each a wagon load (1), some larger, some smaller; against the\n\nrocks they crashed and splintered flying like slingstones in every\n\ndirection--so that it was absolutely out of the question even to\n\napproach the entrance of the pass. Some of the officers finding\n\nthemselves baulked at this point, kept trying other ways, nor did they\n\ndesist till darkness set in; and then, when they thought they would\n\nnot be seen retiring, they returned to supper. Some of them who had\n\nbeen on duty in the rearguard had had no breakfast (it so happened).\n\nHowever, the enemy never ceased rolling down their stones all through\n\nthe night, as was easy to infer from the booming sound.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) I.e. several ton weight.\n\n<br/><br/>\nThe party with the guide made a circuit and surprised the enemy's\n\nguards seated round their fire, and after killing some, and driving\n\nout the rest, took their places, thinking that they were in possession\n\nof the height. As a matter of fact they were not, for above them lay a  6\n\nbreast-like hill (2) skirted by the narrow road on which they had found\n\nthe guards seated. Still, from the spot in question there was an\n\napproach to the enemy, who were seated on the pass before mentioned.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (2) Or, \"mamelon.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nHere then they passed the night, but at the first glimpse of dawn they\n\nmarched stealthily and in battle order against the enemy. There was a\n\nmist, so that they could get quite close without being observed. But\n\nas soon as they caught sight of one another, the trumpet sounded, and\n", "with a loud cheer they rushed upon the fellows, who did not wait their\n\ncoming, but left the road and made off; with the loss of only a few\n\nlives however, so nimble were they. Cheirisophus and his men, catching\n\nthe sound of the bugle, charged up by the well-marked road, while\n\nothers of the generals pushed their way up by pathless routes, where\n\neach division chanced to be; the men mounting as they were best able,\n\nand hoisting one another up by means of their spears; and these were\n\nthe first to unite with the party who had already taken the position\n\nby storm. Xenophon, with the rearguard, followed the path which the\n\nparty with the guide had taken, since it was easiest for the beasts of\n\nburthen; one half of his men he had posted in rear of the baggage\n\nanimals; the other half he had with himself. In their course they\n\nencountered a crest above the road, occupied by the enemy, whom they\n\nmust either dislodge or be themselves cut off from the rest of the\n\nHellenes. The men by themselves could have taken the same route as the\n\nrest, but the baggage animals could not mount by any other way than\n\nthis.\n\n<br/><br/>\nHere then, with shouts of encouragement to each other, they dashed at\n\nthe hill with their storming columns, not from all sides, but leaving\n\nan avenue of escape for the enemy, if he chose to avail himself of it.\n\nFor a while, as the men scrambled up where each best could, the\n\nnatives kept up a fire of arrows and darts, yet did not receive them\n\nat close quarters, but presently left the position in flight. No\n\nsooner, however, were the Hellenes safely past this crest, than they\n\ncame in sight of another in front of them, also occupied, and deemed\n\nit advisable to storm it also. But now it struck Xenophon that if they  13\n\nleft the ridge just taken unprotected in their rear, the enemy might\n\nre-occupy it and attack the baggage animals as they filed past,\n\npresenting a long extended line owing to the narrowness of the road by\n", "which they made their way. To obviate this, he left some officers in\n\ncharge of the ridge--Cephisodorus, son of Cephisophon, an Athenian;\n\nAmphicrates, the son of Amphidemus, an Athenian; and Archagoras, an\n\nArgive exile--while he in person with the rest of the men attacked the\n\nsecond ridge; this they took in the same fashion, only to find that\n\nthey had still a third knoll left, far the steepest of the three. This\n\nwas none other than the mamelon mentioned as above the outpost, which\n\nhad been captured over their fire by the volunteer storming party in\n\nthe night. But when the Hellenes were close, the natives, to the\n\nastonishment of all, without a struggle deserted the knoll. It was\n\nconjectured that they had left their position from fear of being\n\nencircled and besieged, but the fact was that they, from their higher\n\nground, had been able to see what was going on in the rear, and had\n\nall made off in this fashion to attack the rearguard.\n\n<br/><br/>\nSo then Xenophon, with the youngest men, scaled up to the top, leaving\n\norders to the rest to march on slowly, so as to allow the hindmost\n\ncompanies to unite with them; they were to advance by the road, and\n\nwhen they reached the level to ground arms (3). Meanwhile the Argive\n\nArchagoras arrived, in full flight, with the announcement that they\n\nhad been dislodged from the first ridge, and that Cephisodorus and\n\nAmphicrates were slain, with a number of others besides, all in fact\n\nwho had not jumped down the crags and so reached the rearguard. After\n\nthis achievement the barbarians came to a crest facing the mamelon,\n\nand Xenophon held a colloquy with them by means of an interpreter, to\n\nnegotiate a truce, and demanded back the dead bodies. These they\n\nagreed to restore if he would not burn their houses, and to these\n\nterms Xenophon agreed. Meanwhile, as the rest of the army filed past,\n\nand the colloquy was proceeding, all the people of the place had time\n\nto gather gradually, and the enemy formed; and as soon as the Hellenes\n", "began to descend from the mamelon to join the others where the troops\n\nwere halted, on rushed the foe, in full force, with hue and cry. They   20\n\nreached the summit of the mamelon from which Xenophon was descending,\n\nand began rolling down crags. One man's leg was crushed to pieces.\n\nXenophon was left by his shield-bearer, who carried off his shield,\n\nbut Eurylochus of Lusia (4), an Arcadian hoplite, ran up to him, and\n\nthrew his shield in front to protect both of them; so the two together\n\nbeat a retreat, and so too the rest, and joined the serried ranks of\n\nthe main body.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (3) To take up position.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (4) I.e. of Lusi (or Lusia), a town (or district) in Northern Arcadia.\n\n<br/><br/>\nAfter this the whole Hellenic force united, and took up their quarters\n\nthere in numerous beautiful dwellings, with an ample store of\n\nprovisions, for there was wine so plentiful that they had it in\n\ncemented cisterns. Xenophon and Cheirisophus arranged to recover the\n\ndead, and in return restored the guide; afterwards they did everything\n\nfor the dead, according to the means at their disposal, with the\n\ncustomary honours paid to good men.\n\n<br/><br/>\nNext day they set off without a guide; and the enemy, by keeping up a\n\ncontinuous battle and occupying in advance every narrow place,\n\nobstructed passage after passage. Accordingly, whenever the van was\n\nobstructed, Xenophon, from behind, made a dash up the hills and broke\n\nthe barricade, and freed the vanguard by endeavouring to get above the\n\nobstructing enemy. Whenever the rear was the point attacked,\n\nCheirisophus, in the same way, made a detour, and by endeavouring to\n\nmount higher than the barricaders, freed the passage for the rear\n", "rank; and in this way, turn and turn about, they rescued each other,\n\nand paid unflinching attention to their mutual needs. At times it\n\nhappened that, the relief party having mounted, encountered\n\nconsiderable annoyance in their descent from the barbarians, who were\n\nso agile that they allowed them to come up quite close, before they\n\nturned back, and still escaped, partly no doubt because the only\n\nweapons they had to carry were bows and slings.\n\n<br/><br/>\nThey were, moreover, excellent archers, using bows nearly three cubits\n\nlong and arrows more than two cubits. When discharging the arrow, they\n\ndraw the string by getting a purchase with the left foot planted        28\n\nforward on the lower end of the bow. The arrows pierced through shield\n\nand cuirass, and the Hellenes, when they got hold of them, used them\n\nas javelins, fitting them to their thongs. In these districts the\n\nCretans were highly serviceable. They were under the command of\n\nStratocles, a Cretan.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nIII\n\n<br/><br/>\nDuring this day they bivouacked in the villages which lie above the     1\n\nplain of the river Centrites (1), which is about two hundred feet\n\nbroad. It is the frontier river between Armenia and the country of the\n\nCarduchians. Here the Hellenes recruited themselves, and the sight of\n\nthe plain filled them with joy, for the river was but six or seven\n\nfurlongs distant from the mountains of the Carduchians. For the moment\n\nthen they bivouacked right happily; they had their provisions, they\n\nhad also many memories of the labours that were now passed; seeing\n", "that the last seven days spent in traversing the country of the\n\nCarduchians had been one long continuous battle, which had cost them\n\nmore suffering than the whole of their troubles at the hands of the\n\nking and Tissaphernes put together. As though they were truly quit of\n\nthem for ever, they laid their heads to rest in sweet content.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) I.e. the Eastern Tigris.\n\n<br/><br/>\nBut with the morrow's dawn they espied horsemen at a certain point\n\nacross the river, armed cap-a-pie, as if they meant to dispute the\n\npassage. Infantry, too, drawn up in line upon the banks above the\n\ncavalry, threatened to prevent them debouching into Armenia. These\n\ntroops were Armenian and Mardian and Chaldaean mercenaries belonging\n\nto Orontas and Artuchas. The last of the three, the Chaldaeans, were\n\nsaid to be a free and brave set of people. They were armed with long\n\nwicker shields and lances. The banks before named on which they were\n\ndrawn up were a hundred yards or more distant from the river, and the\n\nsingle road which was visible was one leading upwards and looking like\n\na regular artificially constructed highway. At this point the Hellenes\n\nendeavoured to cross, but on their making the attempt the water proved  6\n\nto be more than breast-deep, and the river bed was rough with great\n\nslippery stones, and as to holding their arms in the water, it was out\n\nof the question--the stream swept them away--or if they tried to carry\n\nthem over the head, the body was left exposed to the arrows and other\n\nmissiles; accordingly they turned back and encamped there by the bank\n\nof the river.\n\n<br/><br/>\nAt the point where they had themselves been last night, up on the\n\nmountains, they could see the Carduchians collected in large numbers\n\nand under arms. A shadow of deep despair again descended on their\n", "souls, whichever way they turned their eyes--in front lay the river so\n\ndifficult to ford; over, on the other side, a new enemy threatening to\n\nbar the passage; on the hills behind, the Carduchians ready to fall\n\nupon their rear should they once again attempt to cross. Thus for this\n\nday and night they halted, sunk in perplexity. But Xenophon had a\n\ndream. In his sleep he thought that he was bound in fetters, but\n\nthese, of their own accord, fell from off him, so that he was loosed,\n\nand could stretch his legs as freely as he wished (2). So at the first\n\nglimpse of daylight he came to Cheirisophus and told him that he had\n\nhopes that all things would go well, and related to him his dream.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (2) It is impossible to give the true sense and humour of the passage\n\n    in English, depending, as it does, on the double meaning of\n\n    {diabainein} (1) to cross (a river), (2) to stride or straddle (of\n\n    the legs). The army is unable to cross the Centrites; Xenophon\n\n    dreams that he is fettered, but the chains drop off his legs and\n\n    he is able to stride as freely as ever; next morning the two young\n\n    men come to him with the story how they have found themselves able\n\n    to walk cross the river instead of having to swim it. It is\n\n    obvious to Xenophon that the dream is sent from Heaven.\n\n<br/><br/>\nThe other was well pleased, and with the first faint gleam of dawn the\n\ngenerals all were present and did sacrifice; and the victims were\n\nfavourable in the first essay. Retiring from the sacrifice, the\n\ngenerals and officers issued an order to the troops to take their\n\nbreakfasts; and while Xenophon was taking his, two young men came\n\nrunning up to him, for every one knew that, breakfasting or supping,\n\nhe was always accessible, or that even if asleep any one was welcome\n\nto awaken him who had anything to say bearing on the business of war.   10\n\nWhat the two young men had at this time to say was that they had been\n", "collecting brushwood for fire, and had presently espied on the\n\nopposite side, in among some rocks which came down to the river's\n\nbrink, an old man and some women and little girls depositing, as it\n\nwould appear, bags of clothes in a cavernous rock. When they saw them,\n\nit struck them that it was safe to cross; in any case the enemy's\n\ncavalry could not approach at this point. So they stripped naked,\n\nexpecting to have to swim for it, and with their long knives in their\n\nhands began crossing, but going forward crossed without being wet up\n\nto the fork. Once across they captured the clothes, and came back\n\nagain.\n\n<br/><br/>\nAccordingly Xenophon at once poured out a libation himself, and bade\n\nthe two young fellows fill the cup and pray to the gods, who showed to\n\nhim this vision and to them a passage, to bring all other blessings\n\nfor them to accomplishment. When he had poured out the libation, he at\n\nonce led the two young men to Cheirisophus, and they repeated to him\n\ntheir story. Cheirisophus, on hearing it, offered libations also, and\n\nwhen they had performed them, they sent a general order to the troops\n\nto pack up ready for starting, while they themselves called a meeting\n\nof the generals and took counsel how they might best effect a passage,\n\nso as to overpower the enemy in front without suffering any loss from\n\nthe men behind. And they resolved that Cheirisophus should lead the\n\nvan and cross with half the army, the other half still remaining\n\nbehind under Xenophon, while the baggage animals and the mob of\n\nsutlers were to cross between the two divisions.\n\n<br/><br/>\nWhen all was duly ordered the move began, the young men pioneering\n\nthem, and keeping the river on their left. It was about four furlongs'\n\nmarch to the crossing, and as they moved along the bank, the squadrons\n\nof cavalry kept pace with them on the opposite side.\n", "<br/><br/>\nBut when they had reached a point in a line with the ford, and the\n\ncliff-like banks of the river, they grounded arms, and first\n\nCheirisophus himself placed a wreath upon his brows, and throwing off   17\n\nhis cloak (3), resumed his arms, passing the order to all the rest to\n\ndo the same, and bade the captains form their companies in open order\n\nin deep columns, some to left and some to right of himself. Meanwhile\n\nthe soothsayers were slaying a victim over the river, and the enemy\n\nwere letting fly their arrows and slingstones; but as yet they were\n\nout of range. As soon as the victims were favourable, all the soldiers\n\nbegan singing the battle hymn, and with the notes of the paean mingled\n\nthe shouting of the men accompanied by the shriller chant of the\n\nwomen, for there were many women (4) in the camp.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (3) Or, \"having doffed it,\" i.e. the wreath, an action which the\n\n    soldiers would perform symbolically, if Grote is right in his\n\n    interpretation of the passage, \"Hist. of Greece,\" vol. ix. p. 137.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (4) Lit. \"comrade-women.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nSo Cheirisophus with his detachment stepped in. But Xenophon, taking\n\nthe most active-bodied of the rearguard, began running back at full\n\nspeed to the passage facing the egress into the hills of Armenia,\n\nmaking a feint of crossing at that point to intercept their cavalry on\n\nthe river bank. The enemy, seeing Cheirisophus's detachment easily\n\ncrossing the stream, and Xenophon's men racing back, were seized with\n\nthe fear of being intercepted, and fled at full speed in the direction\n\nof the road which emerges from the stream. But when they were come\n\nopposite to it they raced up hill towards their mountains. Then\n\nLycius, who commanded the cavalry, and Aeschines, who was in command\n", "of the division of light infantry attached to Cheirisophus, no sooner\n\nsaw them fleeing so lustily than they were after them, and the\n\nsoldiers shouted not to fall behind (5), but to follow them right up to\n\nthe mountains. Cheirisophus, on getting across, forbore to pursue the\n\ncavalry, but advanced by the bluffs which reached to the river to\n\nattack the enemy overhead. And these, seeing their own cavalry\n\nfleeing, seeing also the heavy infantry advancing upon them, abandoned\n\nthe heights above the river.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (5) Or, \"to stick tight to them and not to be outdone\"; or, as others\n\n    understand, \"the (infantry) soldiers clamoured not to be left\n\n    behind, but to follow them up into the mountains.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nXenophon, as soon as he saw that things were going well on the other    24\n\nside, fell back with all speed to join the troops engaged in crossing,\n\nfor by this time the Carduchians were well in sight, descending into\n\nthe plain to attack their rear.\n\n<br/><br/>\nCheirisophus was in possession of the higher ground, and Lycius, with\n\nhis little squadron, in an attempt to follow up the pursuit, had\n\ncaptured some stragglers of their baggage-bearers, and with them some\n\nhandsome apparel and drinking-cups. The baggage animals of the\n\nHellenes and the mob of non-combatants were just about to cross, when\n\nXenonphon turned his troops right about to face the Carduchians.\n\nVis-a-vis he formed his line, passing the order to the captains each\n\nto form his company into sections, and to deploy them into line by the\n\nleft, the captains of companies and lieutenants in command of sections\n\nto advance to meet the Carduchians, while the rear leaders would keep\n\ntheir position facing the river. But when the Carduchians saw the\n\nrearguard so stript of the mass, and looking now like a mere handful\n", "of men, they advanced all the more quickly, singing certain songs the\n\nwhile. Then, as matters were safe with him, Cheirisophus sent back the\n\npeltasts and slingers and archers to join Xenophon, with orders to\n\ncarry out his instructions. They were in the act of recrossing, when\n\nXenophon, who saw their intention, sent a messenger across, bidding\n\nthem wait there at the river's brink without crossing; but as soon as\n\nhe and his detachment began to cross they were to step in facing him\n\nin two flanking divisions right and left of them, as if in the act of\n\ncrossing; the javelin men with their javelins on the thong, and the\n\nbowmen with their arrows on the string; but they were not to advance\n\nfar into the stream. The order passed to his own men was: \"Wait till\n\nyou are within sling-shot, and the shield rattles, then sound the\n\npaean and charge the enemy. As soon as he turns, and the bugle from\n\nthe river sounds for 'the attack,' you will face about to the right,\n\nthe rear rank leading, and the whole detachment falling back and\n\ncrossing the river as quickly as possible, every one preserving his\n\noriginal rank, so as to avoid tramelling one another: the bravest man\n\nis he who gets to the other side first.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nThe Carduchians, seeing that the remnant left was the merest handful    30\n\n(for many even of those whose duty it was to remain had gone off in\n\ntheir anxiety to protect their beasts of burden, or their personal\n\nkit, or their mistresses), bore down upon them valorously, and opened\n\nfire with slingstones and arrows. But the Hellenes, raising the battle\n\nhymn, dashed at them at a run, and they did not await them; armed well\n\nenough for mountain warfare, and with a view to sudden attack followed\n\nby speedy flight, they were not by any means sufficiently equipped for\n\nan engagement at close quarters. At this instant the signal of the\n\nbugle was heard. Its notes added wings to the flight of the\n\nbarbarians, but the Hellenes turned right about in the opposite\n", "direction, and betook themselves to the river with what speed they\n\nmight. Some of the enemy, here a man and there another, perceived, and\n\nrunning back to the river, let fly their arrows and wounded a few; but\n\nthe majority, even when the Hellenes were well across, were still to\n\nbe seen pursuing their flight. The detachment which came to meet\n\nXenophon's men, carried away by their valour, advanced further than\n\nthey had need to, and had to cross back again in the rear of\n\nXenophon's men, and of these too a few were wounded.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nIV\n\n<br/><br/>\nThe passage effected, they fell into line about mid-day, and marched    1\n\nthrough Armenian territory, one long plain with smooth rolling\n\nhillocks, not less than five parasangs in distance; for owing to the\n\nwars of this people with the Carduchians there were no villages near\n\nthe river. The village eventually reached was large, and possessed a\n\npalace belonging to the satrap, and most of the houses were crowned\n\nwith turrets; provisions were plentiful.\n\n<br/><br/>\nFrom this village they marched two stages--ten parasangs--until they\n\nhad surmounted the sources of the river Tigris; and from this point\n\nthey marched three stages--fifteen parasangs--to the river Teleboas.\n\nThis was a fine stream, though not large, and there were many\n\nvillages about it. The district was named Western Armenia. The\n\nlieutenant-governor of it was Tiribazus, the king's friend, and\n\nwhenever the latter paid a visit, he alone had the privilege of\n\nmounting the king upon his horse. This officer rode up to the Hellenes\n", "with a body of cavalry, and sending forward an interpreter, stated\n\nthat he desired a colloquy with the leaders. The generals resolved to   5\n\nhear what he had to say; and advancing on their side to within\n\nspeaking distance, they demanded what he wanted. He replied that he\n\nwished to make a treaty with them, in accordance with which he on his\n\nside would abstain from injuring the Hellenes, if they would not burn\n\nhis houses, but merely take such provisions as they needed. This\n\nproposal satisfied the generals, and a treaty was made on the terms\n\nsuggested.\n\n<br/><br/>\nFrom this place they marched three stages--fifteen parasangs--through\n\nplain country, Tiribazus the while keeping close behind with his own\n\nforces more than a mile off. Presently they reached a palace with\n\nvillages clustered round about it, which were full of supplies in\n\ngreat variety. But while they were encamping in the night, there was a\n\nheavy fall of snow, and in the morning it was resolved to billet out\n\nthe different regiments, with their generals, throughout the villages.\n\nThere was no enemy in sight, and the proceeding seemed prudent, owing\n\nto the quantity of snow. In these quarters they had for provisions all\n\nthe good things there are--sacrificial beasts, corn, old wines with an\n\nexquisite bouquet, dried grapes, and vegetables of all sorts. But some\n\nof the stragglers from the camp reported having seen an army, and the\n\nblaze of many watchfires in the night. Accordingly the generals\n\nconcluded that it was not prudent to separate their quarters in this\n\nway, and a resolution was passed to bring the troops together again.\n\nAfter that they reunited, the more so that the weather promised to be\n\nfine with a clear sky; but while they lay there in open quarters,\n\nduring the night down came so thick a fall of snow that it completely\n\ncovered up the stacks of arms and the men themselves lying down. It\n\ncramped and crippled the baggage animals; and there was great\n", "unreadiness to get up, so gently fell the snow as they lay there warm\n\nand comfortable, and formed a blanket, except where it slipped off the\n\nsleepers' shoulders; and it was not until Xenophon roused himself to\n\nget up, and, without his cloak on (1), began to split wood, that\n\nquickly first one and then another got up, and taking the log away      12\n\nfrom him, fell to splitting. Thereat the rest followed suit, got up,\n\nand began kindling fire and oiling their bodies, for there was a\n\nscented unguent to be found there in abundance, which they used\n\ninstead of oil. It was made from pig's fat, sesame, bitter almonds,\n\nand turpentine. There was a sweet oil also to be found, made of the\n\nsame ingredients.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) Or, as we should say, \"in his shirt sleeves.\" Doubtless he lay\n\n    with his {imation} or cloak loosely wrapped round him; as he\n\n    sprang to his feet he would throw it off, or it would fall off,\n\n    and with the simple inner covering of the {khiton} to protect him,\n\n    and arms free, he fell to chopping the wood, only half clad.\n\n<br/><br/>\nAfter this it was resolved that they must again separate their\n\nquarters and get under cover in the villages. At this news the\n\nsoldiers, with much joy and shouting, rushed upon the covered houses\n\nand the provisions; but all who in their blind folly had set fire to\n\nthe houses when they left them before, now paid the penalty in the\n\npoor quarters they got. From this place one night they sent off a\n\nparty under Democrates, a Temenite (2), up into the mountains, where\n\nthe stragglers reported having seen watchfires. The leader selected\n\nwas a man whose judgement might be depended upon to verify the truth\n\nof the matter. With a happy gift to distinguish between fact and\n\nfiction, he had often been successfully appealed to. He went and\n\nreported that he had seen no watchfires, but he had got a man, whom he\n", "brought back with him, carrying a Persian bow and quiver, and a\n\nsagaris or battleaxe like those worn by the Amazons. When asked \"from\n\nwhat country he came,\" the prisoner answered that he was \"a Persian,\n\nand was going from the army of Tiribazus to get provisions.\" They next\n\nasked him \"how large the army was, and for what object it had been\n\ncollected.\" His answer was that \"it consisted of Tiribazus at the head\n\nof his own forces, and aided by some Chalybian and Taochian\n\nmercenaries. Tiribazus had got it together,\" he added, \"meaning to\n\nattack the Hellenes on the high mountain pass, in a defile which was\n\nthe sole passage.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\n (2) Reading {Temeniten}, i.e. a native of Temenus, a district of\n\n    Syracuse; al. {Temniten}, i.e. from Temnus in the Aeolid; al.\n\n    {Temeniten}, i.e. from Temenum in the Argolid.\n\n<br/><br/>\nWhen the generals heard this news, they resolved to collect the\n\ntroops, and they set off at once, taking the prisoner to act as guide,\n\nand leaving a garrison behind with Sophaenetus the Stymphalian in       19\n\ncommand of those who remained in the camp. As soon as they had begun\n\nto cross the hills, the light infantry, advancing in front and\n\ncatching sight of the camp, did not wait for the heavy infantry, but\n\nwith a loud shout rushed upon the enemy's entrenchment. The natives,\n\nhearing the din and clatter, did not care to stop, but took rapidly to\n\ntheir heels. But, for all their expedition, some of them were killed,\n\nand as many as twenty horses were captured, with the tent of\n\nTiribazus, and its contents, silver-footed couches and goblets,\n\nbesides certain persons styling themselves the butlers and bakers. As\n\nsoon as the generals of the heavy infantry division had learnt the\n\nnews, they resolved to return to the camp with all speed, for fear of\n\nan attack being made on the remnant left behind. The recall was\n", "sounded and the retreat commenced; the camp was reached the same day.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nV\n\n<br/><br/>\nThe next day it was resolved that they should set off with all          1\n\npossible speed, before the enemy had time to collect and occupy the\n\ndefile. Having got their kit and baggage together, they at once began\n\ntheir march through deep snow with several guides, and, crossing the\n\nhigh pass the same day on which Tiribazus was to have attacked them,\n\ngot safely into cantonments. From this point they marched three desert\n\nstages--fifteen parassangs--to the river Euphrates, and crossed it in\n\nwater up to the waist. The sources of the river were reported to be at\n\nno great distance. From this place they marched through deep snow over\n\na flat country three stages--fifteen parasangs (1). The last of these\n\nmarches was trying, with the north wind blowing in their teeth, drying\n\nup everything and benumbing the men. Here one of the seers suggested\n\nto them to do sacrifice to Boreas, and sacrifice was done. The effect\n\nwas obvious to all in the diminished fierceness of the blast. But\n\nthere was six feet of snow, so that many of the baggage animals and\n\nslaves were lost, and about thirty of the men themselves.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) Al. \"ten,\" al. \"five.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nThey spent the whole night in kindling fire; for there was fortunately\n\nno dearth of wood at the halting-place; only those who came late into\n\ncamp had no wood. Accordingly those who had arrived a good while and    5\n\nhad kindled fires were not for allowing these late-comers near the\n", "fires, unless they would in return give a share of their corn or of\n\nany other victuals they might have. Here then a general exchange of\n\ngoods was set up. Where the fire was kindled the snow melted, and\n\ngreat trenches formed themselves down to the bare earth, and here it\n\nwas possible to measure the depth of the snow.\n\n<br/><br/>\nLeaving these quarters, they marched the whole of the next day over\n\nsnow, and many of the men were afflicted with \"boulimia\" (or\n\nhunger-faintness). Xenophon, who was guarding the rear, came upon some\n\nmen who had dropt down, and he did not know what ailed them; but some\n\none who was experienced in such matters suggested to him that they had\n\nevidently got boulimia; and if they got something to eat, they would\n\nrevive. Then he went the round of the baggage train, and laying an\n\nembargo on any eatables he could see, doled out with his own hands, or\n\nsent off other able-bodied agents to distribute to the sufferers, who\n\nas soon as they had taken a mouthful got on their legs again and\n\ncontinued the march.\n\n<br/><br/>\nOn and on they marched, and about dusk Cheirisophus reached a village,\n\nand surprised some women and girls who had come from the village to\n\nfetch water at the fountain outside the stockade. These asked them who\n\nthey were. The interpreters answered for them in Persian: \"They were\n\non their way from the king to the satrap;\" in reply to which the women\n\ngave them to understand that the satrap was not at home, but was away\n\na parasang farther on. As it was late they entered with the\n\nwater-carriers within the stockade to visit the headman of the\n\nvillage. Accordingly Cheirisophus and as many of the troops as were\n\nable got into cantonments there, while the rest of the soldiers--those\n\nnamely who were unable to complete the march--had to spend the night\n\nout, without food and without fire; under the circumstances some of\n", "the men perished.\n\n<br/><br/>\nOn the heels of the army hung perpetually bands of the enemy,\n\nsnatching away disabled baggage animals and fighting with each other\n\nover the carcases. And in its track not seldom were left to their fate\n\ndisabled soldiers, struck down with snow-blindness or with toes         12\n\nmortified by frostbite. As to the eyes, it was some alleviation\n\nagainst the snow to march with something black before them; for the\n\nfeet, the only remedy was to keep in motion without stopping for an\n\ninstant, and to loose the sandal at night. If they went to sleep with\n\nthe sandals on, the thong worked into the feet, and the sandals were\n\nfrozen fast to them. This was partly due to the fact that, since their\n\nold sandals had failed, they wore untanned brogues made of\n\nnewly-flayed ox-hides. It was owing to some such dire necessity that a\n\nparty of men fell out and were left behind, and seeing a black-looking\n\npatch of ground where the snow had evidently disappeared, they\n\nconjectured it must have been melted; and this was actually so, owing\n\nto a spring of some sort which was to be seen steaming up in a dell\n\nclose by. To this they had turned aside and sat down, and were loth to\n\ngo a step further. But Xenophon, with his rearguard, perceived them,\n\nand begged and implored them by all manner of means not to be left\n\nbehind, telling them that the enemy were after them in large packs\n\npursuing; and he ended by growing angry. They merely bade him put a\n\nknife to their throats; not one step farther would they stir. Then it\n\nseemed best to frighten the pursuing enemy if possible, and prevent\n\ntheir falling upon the invalids. It was already dusk, and the pursuers\n\nwere advancing with much noise and hubbub, wrangling and disputing\n\nover their spoils. Then all of a sudden the rearguard, in the\n\nplenitude of health and strength (2), sprang up out of their lair and\n\nrun upon the enemy, whilst those weary wights (3) bawled out as loud as\n", "their sick throats could sound, and clashed their spears against their\n\nshields; and the enemy in terror hurled themselves through the snow\n\ninto the dell, and not one of them ever uttered a sound again.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (2) Hug, after Rehdantz, would omit the words \"in the plenitude of\n\n    health and strength.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\n (3) Or, \"the invalids.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nXenophon and his party, telling the sick folk that next day people\n\nwould come for them, set off, and before they had gone half a mile\n\nthey fell in with some soldiers who had laid down to rest on the snow\n\nwith their cloaks wrapped round them, but never a guard was\n\nestablished, and they made them get up. Their explanation was that      19\n\nthose in front would not move on. Passing by this group he sent\n\nforward the strongest of his light infantry in advance, with orders to\n\nfind out what the stoppage was. They reported that the whole army lay\n\nreposing in such fashion. That being so, Xenophon's men had nothing\n\nfor it but to bivouac in the open air also, without fire and\n\nsupperless, merely posting what pickets they could under the\n\ncircumstances. But as soon as it drew towards day, Xenophon despatched\n\nthe youngest of his men to the sick folk behind, with orders to make\n\nthem get up and force them to proceed. Meanwhile Cheirisophus had sent\n\nsome of his men quartered in the village to enquire how they fared in\n\nthe rear; they were overjoyed to see them, and handed over the sick\n\nfolk to them to carry into camp, while they themselves continued their\n\nmarch forward, and ere twenty furlongs were past reached the village\n\nin which Cheirisophus was quartered. As soon as the two divisions were\n\nmet, the resolution was come to that it would be safe to billet the\n\nregiments throughout the villages; Cheirisophus remained where he was,\n", "while the rest drew lots for the villages in sight, and then, with\n\ntheir several detachments, marched off to their respective\n\ndestinations.\n\n<br/><br/>\nIt was here that Polycrates, an Athenian and captain of a company,\n\nasked for leave of absence--he wished to be off on a quest of his own;\n\nand putting himself at the head of the active men of the division, he\n\nran to the village which had been allotted to Xenophon. He surprised\n\nwithin it the villagers with their headman, and seventeen young horses\n\nwhich were being reared as a tribute for the king, and, last of all,\n\nthe headman's own daughter, a young bride only eight days wed. Her\n\nhusband had gone off to chase hares, and so he escaped being taken\n\nwith the other villagers. The houses were underground structures with\n\nan aperture like the mouth of a well by which to enter, but they were\n\nbroad and spacious below. The entrance for the beasts of burden was\n\ndug out, but the human occupants descended by a ladder. In these\n\ndwellings were to be found goats and sheep and cattle, and cocks and\n\nhens, with their various progeny. The flocks and herds were all reared\n\nunder cover upon green food. There were stores within of wheat and\n\nbarley and vegetables, and wine made from barley in great big bowls;    26\n\nthe grains of barley malt lay floating in the beverage up to the lip\n\nof the vessel, and reeds lay in them, some longer, some shorter,\n\nwithout joints; when you were thirsty you must take one of these into\n\nyour mouth, and suck. The beverage without admixture of water was very\n\nstrong, and of a delicious flavour to certain palates, but the taste\n\nmust be acquired.\n\n<br/><br/>\nXenophon made the headman of the village his guest at supper, and bade\n\nhim keep a good heart; so far from robbing him of his children, they\n\nwould fill his house full of good things in return for what they took\n", "before they went away; only he must set them an example, and discover\n\nsome blessing or other for the army, until they found themselves with\n\nanother tribe. To this he readily assented, and with the utmost\n\ncordiality showed them the cellar where the wine was buried. For this\n\nnight then, having taken up their several quarters as described, they\n\nslumbered in the midst of plenty, one and all, with the headman under\n\nwatch and ward, and his children with him safe in sight.\n\n<br/><br/>\nBut on the following day Xenophon took the headman and set off to\n\nCheirisophus, making a round of the villages, and at each place\n\nturning in to visit the different parties. Everywhere alike he found\n\nthem faring sumptuously and merry-making. There was not a single\n\nvillage where they did not insist on setting a breakfast before them,\n\nand on the same table were spread half a dozen dishes at least, lamb,\n\nkid, pork, veal, fowls, with various sorts of bread, some of wheat and\n\nsome of barley. When, as an act of courtesy, any one wished to drink\n\nhis neighbour's health, he would drag him to the big bowl, and when\n\nthere, he must duck his head and take a long pull, drinking like an\n\nox. The headman, they insisted everywhere, must accept as a present\n\nwhatever he liked to have. But he would accept nothing, except where\n\nhe espied any of his relations, when he made a point of taking them\n\noff, him or her, with himself.\n\n<br/><br/>\nWhen they reached Cheirisophus they found a similar scene. There too    33\n\nthe men were feasting in their quarters, garlanded with whisps of hay\n\nand dry grass, and Armenian boys were playing the part of waiters in\n\nbarbaric costumes, only they had to point out by gesture to the boys\n\nwhat they were to do, like deaf and dumb. After the first formalities,\n\nwhen Cheirisophus and Xenophon had greeted one another like bosom\n\nfriends, they interrogated the headman in common by means of the\n", "Persian-speaking interpreter. \"What was the country?\" they asked: he\n\nreplied, \"Armenia.\" And again, \"For whom are the horses being bred?\"\n\n\"They are tribute for the king,\" he replied. \"And the neighbouring\n\ncountry?\" \"Is the land of the Chalybes,\" he said; and he described the\n\nroad which led to it. So for the present Xenophon went off, taking the\n\nheadman back with him to his household and friends. He also made him a\n\npresent of an oldish horse which he had got; he had heard that the\n\nheadman was a priest of the sun, and so he could fatten up the beast\n\nand sacrifice him; otherwise he was afraid it might die outright, for\n\nit had been injured by the long marching. For himself he took his pick\n\nof the colts, and gave a colt apiece to each of his fellow-generals\n\nand officers. The horses here were smaller than the Persian horses,\n\nbut much more spirited. It was here too that their friend the headman\n\nexplained to them, how they should wrap small bags or sacks around the\n\nfeet of the horses and other cattle when marching through the snow,\n\nfor without such precautions the creatures sank up to their bellies.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nVI\n\n<br/><br/>\nWhen a week had passed, on the eighth day Xenophon delivered over the   1\n\nguide (that is to say, the village headman) to Cheirisophus. He left\n\nthe headman's household safe behind in the village, with the exception\n\nof his son, a lad in the bloom of youth. This boy was entrusted to\n\nEpisthenes of Amphipolis to guard; if the headman proved himself a\n\ngood guide, he was to take away his son also at his departure. They\n\nfinally made his house the repository of all the good things they\n\ncould contrive to get together; then they broke up their camp and\n", "commenced to march, the headman guiding them through the snow\n\nunfettered. When they had reached the third stage Cheirisophus flew     2\n\ninto a rage with him, because he had not brought them to any villages.\n\nThe headman pleaded that there were none in this part. Cheirisophus\n\nstruck him, but forgot to bind him, and the end of it was that the\n\nheadman ran away in the night and was gone, leaving his son behind\n\nhim. This was the sole ground of difference between Cheirisophus and\n\nXenophon during the march, this combination of ill-treatment and\n\nneglect in the case of the guide. As to the boy, Episthenes conceived\n\na passion for him, and took him home with him, and found in him the\n\nmost faithful of friends.\n\n<br/><br/>\nAfter this they marched seven stages at the rate of five parasangs a\n\nday, to the banks of the river Phasis (1), which is a hundred feet\n\nbroad: and thence they marched another couple of stages, ten\n\nparasangs; but at the pass leading down into the plain there appeared\n\nin front of them a mixed body of Chalybes and Taochians and\n\nPhasianians. When Cheirisophus caught sight of the enemy on the pass\n\nat a distance of about three or four miles, he ceased marching, not\n\ncaring to approach the enemy with his troops in column, and he passed\n\ndown the order to the others: to deploy their companies to the front,\n\nthat the troops might form into line. As soon as the rearguard had\n\ncome up, he assembled the generals and officers, and addressed them:\n\n\"The enemy, as you see, are in occupation of the mountain pass, it is\n\ntime we should consider how we are to make the best fight to win it.\n\nMy opinion is, that we should give orders to the troops to take their\n\nmorning meal, whilst we deliberate whether we should cross the\n\nmountains to-day or to-morrow.\" \"My opinion,\" said Cleanor, \"is, that\n\nas soon as we have breakfasted, we should arm for the fight and attack\n\nthe enemy, without loss of time, for if we fritter away to-day, the\n", "enemy who are now content to look at us, will grow bolder, and with\n\ntheir growing courage, depend upon it, others more numerous will join\n\nthem.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) Probably a tributary of the Araxes = modern Pasin-Su.\n\n<br/><br/>\nAfter him Xenophon spoke: \"This,\" he said, \"is how I see the matter;\n\nif fight we must, let us make preparation to sell our lives dearly,\n\nbut if we desire to cross with the greatest ease, the point to\n\nconsider is, how we may get the fewest wounds and throw away the\n\nsmallest number of good men. Well then, that part of the mountain       11\n\nwhich is visible stretches nearly seven miles. Where are the men\n\nposted to intercept us? except at the road itself, they are nowhere to\n\nbe seen. It is much better to try if possible to steal a point of this\n\ndesert mountain unobserved, and before they know where we are, secure\n\nthe prize, than to fly at a strong position and an enemy thoroughly\n\nprepared. Since it is much easier to march up a mountain without\n\nfighting than to tramp along a level when assailants are at either\n\nhand; and provided he has not to fight, a man will see what lies at\n\nhis feet much more plainly even at night than in broad daylight in the\n\nmidst of battle; and a rough road to feet that roam in peace may be\n\npleasanter than a smooth surface with the bullets whistling about your\n\nears (2). Nor is it so impossible, I take it, to steal a march, since\n\nit is open to us to go by night, when we cannot be seen, and to fall\n\nback so far that they will never notice us. In my opinion, however, if\n\nwe make a feint of attacking here, we shall find the mountain chain\n\nall the more deserted elsewhere, since the enemy will be waiting for\n\nus here in thicker swarm.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (2) Or, more lit., \"with the head a mark for missiles.\"\n", "<br/><br/>\n\"But what right have I to be drawing conclusions about stealing in\n\nyour presence, Cheirisophus? for you Lacedaemonians, as I have often\n\nbeen told, you who belong to the 'peers,' practise stealing from your\n\nboyhood up; and it is no disgrace but honourable rather to steal,\n\nexcept such things as the law forbids; and in order, I presume, to\n\nstimulate your sense of secretiveness, and to make you master thieves,\n\nit is lawful for you further to get a whipping if you are caught. Now\n\nthen you have a fine opportunity of displaying your training. But take\n\ncare we are not caught stealing over the mountain, or we shall catch\n\nit ourselves.\" \"For all that,\" retorted Cheirisophus, \"I have heard\n\nthat you Athenians are clever hands at stealing the public moneys; and\n\nthat too though there is a fearful risk for the person so employed;\n\nbut, I am told, it is your best men who are addicted to it; if it is\n\nyour best men who are thought worthy to rule. So it is a fine\n\nopportunity for yourself also, Xenophon, to exhibit your education.\"    17\n\n\"And I,\" replied Xenophon, \"am ready to take the rear division, as\n\nsoon as we have supped, and seize the mountain chain. I have already\n\ngot guides, for the light troops laid an ambuscade, and seized some of\n\nthe cut-purse vagabonds who hung on our rear. I am further informed by\n\nthem that the mountain is not inaccessible, but is grazed by goats and\n\ncattle, so that if we can once get hold of any portion of it, there\n\nwill be no difficulty as regards our animals--they can cross. As to\n\nthe enemy, I expect they will not even wait for us any longer, when\n\nthey once see us on a level with themselves on the heights, for they\n\ndo not even at present care to come down and meet us on fair ground.\"\n\nCheirisophus answered: \"But why should you go and leave your command\n\nin the rear? Send others rather, unless a band of volunteers will\n\npresent themselves.\" Thereupon Aristonymus the Methydrian came forward\n\nwith some heavy infantry, and Nicomachus the Oetean with another body\n", "of light troops, and they made an agreement to kindle several\n\nwatch-fires as soon as they held the heights. The arrangements made,\n\nthey breakfasted; and after breakfast Cheirisophus advanced the whole\n\narmy ten furlongs closer towards the enemy, so as to strengthen the\n\nimpression that he intended to attack them at that point.\n\n<br/><br/>\nBut as soon as they had supped and night had fallen, the party under\n\norders set off and occupied the mountain, while the main body rested\n\nwhere they were. Now as soon as the enemy perceived that the mountain\n\nwas taken, they banished all thought of sleep, and kept many\n\nwatch-fires blazing throughout the night. But at break of day\n\nCheirisophus offered sacrifice, and began advancing along the road,\n\nwhile the detachment which held the mountain advanced pari passu by\n\nthe high ground. The larger mass of the enemy, on his side, remained\n\nstill on the mountain-pass, but a section of them turned to confront\n\nthe detachment on the heights. Before the main bodies had time to draw\n\ntogether, the detachment on the height came to close quarters, and the\n\nHellenes were victorious and gave chase. Meanwhile the light division\n\nof the Hellenes, issuing from the plain, were rapidly advancing\n\nagainst the serried lines of the enemy, whilst Cheirisophus followed\n\nup with his heavy infantry at quick march. But the enemy on the road    25\n\nno sooner saw their higher division being worsted than they fled, and\n\nsome few of them were slain, and a vast number of wicker shields were\n\ntaken, which the Hellenes hacked to pieces with their short swords and\n\nrendered useless. So when they had reached the summit of the pass,\n\nthey sacrificed and set up a trophy, and descending into the plain,\n\nreached villages abounding in good things of every kind.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>", "<br/><br/>\nVII\n\n<br/><br/>\nAfter this they marched into the country of the Taochians five          1\n\nstages--thirty parasangs--and provisions failed; for the Taochians\n\nlived in strong places, into which they had carried up all their\n\nstores. Now when the army arrived before one of these strong places--a\n\nmere fortress, without city or houses, into which a motley\n\ncrowd of men and women and numerous flocks and herds were\n\ngathered--Cheirisophus attacked at once. When the first regiment fell\n\nback tired, a second advanced, and again a third, for it was\n\nimpossible to surround the place in full force, as it was encircled by\n\na river. Presently Xenophon came up with the rearguard, consisting of\n\nboth light and heavy infantry, whereupon Cheirisophus halted him with\n\nthe words: \"In the nick of time you have come; we must take this\n\nplace, for the troops have no provisions, unless we take it.\"\n\nThereupon they consulted together, and to Xenophon's inquiry, \"What it\n\nwas which hindered their simply walking in?\" Cheirisophus replied,\n\n\"There is just this one narrow approach which you see, but when we\n\nattempt to pass it by they roll down volleys of stones from yonder\n\noverhanging crag,\" pointing up, \"and this is the state in which you\n\nfind yourself, if you chance to be caught;\" and he pointed to some\n\npoor fellows with their legs or ribs crushed to bits. \"But when they\n\nhave expended their ammunition,\" said Xenophon, \"there is nothing\n\nelse, is there, to hinder our passing? Certainly, except yonder\n\nhandful of fellows, there is no one in front of us that we can see;\n\nand of them, only two or three apparently are armed, and the distance\n\nto be traversed under fire is, as your eyes will tell you, about one\n\nhundred and fifty feet as near as can be, and of this space the first\n\nhundred is thickly covered with great pines at intervals; under cover\n", "of these, what harm can come to our men from a pelt of stones, flying   6\n\nor rolling? So then, there is only fifty feet left to cross, during a\n\nlull of stones.\" \"Ay,\" said Cheirisophus, \"but with our first attempt\n\nto approach the bush a galling fire of stones commences.\" \"The very\n\nthing we want,\" said the other, \"for they will use up their ammunition\n\nall the quicker; but let us select a point from which we shall have\n\nonly a brief space to run across, if we can, and from which it will be\n\neasier to get back, if we wish.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nThereupon Cheirisophus and Xenophon set out with Callimachus the\n\nParrhasian, the captain in command of the officers of the rearguard\n\nthat day; the rest of the captains remained out of danger. That done,\n\nthe next step was for a party of about seventy men to get away under\n\nthe trees, not in a body, but one by one, every one using his best\n\nprecaution; and Agasis the Stymphalian, and Aristonymous the\n\nMethydrian, who were also officers of the rearguard, were posted as\n\nsupports outside the trees; for it was not possible for more than a\n\nsingle company to stand safely within the trees. Here Callimachus hit\n\nupon a pretty contrivance--he ran forward from the tree under which he\n\nwas posted two or three paces, and as soon as the stones came\n\nwhizzing, he retired easily, but at each excursion more than ten\n\nwagon-loads of rocks were expended. Agasias, seeing how Callimachus\n\nwas amusing himself, and the whole army looking on as spectators, was\n\nseized with the fear that he might miss his chance of being first to\n\nrun the gauntlet of the enemy's fire and get into the place. So,\n\nwithout a word of summons to his neighbour, Aristonymous, or to\n\nEurylochus of Lusia, both comrades of his, or to any one else, off he\n\nset on his own account, and passed the whole detachment. But\n\nCallimachus, seeing him tearing past, caught hold of his shield by the\n\nrim, and in the meantime Aristonymous the Methydrian ran past both,\n", "and after him Eurylochus of Lusia; for they were one and all aspirants\n\nto valour, and in that high pursuit, each was the eager rival of the\n\nrest. So in this strife of honour, the three of them took the\n\nfortress, and when they had once rushed in, not a stone more was\n\nhurled from overhead.\n\n<br/><br/>\nAnd here a terrible spectacle displayed itself: the women first cast\n\ntheir infants down the cliff, and then they cast themselves after       13\n\ntheir fallen little ones, and the men likewise. In such a scene,\n\nAeneas the Stymphalian, an officer, caught sight of a man with a fine\n\ndress about to throw himself over, and seized hold of him to stop him;\n\nbut the other caught him to his arms, and both were gone in an instant\n\nheadlong down the crags, and were killed. Out of this place the merest\n\nhandful of human beings were taken prisoners, but cattle and asses in\n\nabundance and flocks of sheep.\n\n<br/><br/>\nFrom this place they marched through the Chalybes (1) seven stages,\n\nfifty parasangs. These were the bravest men whom they encountered on\n\nthe whole march, coming cheerily to close quarters with them. They\n\nwore linen cuirasses reaching to the groin, and instead of the\n\nordinary \"wings\" or basques, a thickly-plaited fringe of cords. They\n\nwere also provided with greaves and helmets, and at the girdle a short\n\nsabre, about as long as the Laconian dagger, with which they cut the\n\nthroats of those they mastered, and after severing the head from the\n\ntrunk they would march along carrying it, singing and dancing, when\n\nthey drew within their enemy's field of view. They carried also a\n\nspear fifteen cubits long, lanced at one end (2). This folk stayed in\n\nregular townships, and whenever the Hellenes passed by they invariably\n\nhung close on their heels fighting. They had dwelling-places in their\n\nfortresses, and into them they had carried up their supplies, so that\n", "the Hellenes could get nothing from this district, but supported\n\nthemselves on the flocks and herds they had taken from the Taochians.\n\nAfter this the Hellenes reached the river Harpasus, which was four\n\nhundred feet broad. Hence they marched through the Scythenians four\n\nstages--twenty parasangs--through a long level country to more\n\nvillages, among which they halted three days, and got in supplies.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) These are the Armeno-Chalybes, so called by Pliny in\n\n    contradistinction to another mountain tribe in Pontus so named,\n\n    who were famous for their forging, and from whom steel received\n\n    its Greek name {khalups}. With these latter we shall make\n\n    acquaintance later on.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (2) I.e. with a single point or spike only, the Hellenic spear having\n\n    a spike at the butt end also.\n\n<br/><br/>\nPassing on from thence in four stages of twenty parasangs, they         19\n\nreached a large and prosperous well-populated city, which went by the\n\nname of Gymnias (3), from which the governor of the country sent them a\n\nguide to lead them through a district hostile to his own. This guide\n\ntold them that within five days he would lead them to a place from\n\nwhich they would see the sea, \"and,\" he added, \"if I fail of my word,\n\nyou are free to take my life.\" Accordingly he put himself at their\n\nhead; but he no sooner set foot in the country hostile to himself than\n\nhe fell to encouraging them to burn and harry the land; indeed his\n\nexhortations were so earnest, it was plain that it was for this he had\n\ncome, and not out of the good-will he bore the Hellenes.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (3) Gymnias is supposed (by Grote, \"Hist. of Greece,\" vol. ix. p. 161)\n\n    to be the same as that which is now called Gumisch-Kana--perhaps\n", "    \"at no great distance from Baibut,\" Tozer, \"Turkish Armenia,\" p.\n\n    432. Others have identified it with Erzeroum, others with Ispir.\n\n<br/><br/>\nOn the fifth day they reached the mountain, the name of which was\n\nTheches (4). No sooner had the men in front ascended it and caught\n\nsight of the sea than a great cry arose, and Xenophon, in the\n\nrearguard, catching the sound of it, conjectured that another set of\n\nenemies must surely be attacking in front; for they were followed by\n\nthe inhabitants of the country, which was all aflame; indeed the\n\nrearguard had killed some and captured others alive by laying an\n\nambuscade; they had taken also about twenty wicker shields, covered\n\nwith the raw hides of shaggy oxen.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (4) Some MSS. give \"the sacred mountain.\" The height in question has\n\n    been identified with \"the ridge called Tekieh-Dagh to the east of\n\n    Gumisch-Kana, nearer to the sea than that place\" (Grote, ib. p.\n\n    162), but the exact place from which they caught sight of the sea\n\n    has not been identified as yet, and other mountain ranges have\n\n    been suggested.\n\n<br/><br/>\nBut as the shout became louder and nearer, and those who from time to\n\ntime came up, began racing at the top of their speed towards the\n\nshouters, and the shouting continually recommenced with yet greater\n\nvolume as the numbers increased, Xenophon settled in his mind that\n\nsomething extraordinary must have happened, so he mounted his horse,\n\nand taking with him Lycius and the cavalry, he galloped to the rescue.\n\nPresently they could hear the soldiers shouting and passing on the\n\njoyful word, \"The sea! the sea!\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nThereupon they began running, rearguard and all, and the baggage        24\n", "animals and horses came galloping up. But when they had reached the\n\nsummit, then indeed they fell to embracing one another--generals and\n\nofficers and all--and the tears trickled down their cheeks. And on a\n\nsudden, some one, whoever it was, having passed down the order, the\n\nsoldiers began bringing stones and erecting a great cairn, whereon\n\nthey dedicated a host of untanned skins, and staves, and captured\n\nwicker shields, and with his own hand the guide hacked the shields to\n\npieces, inviting the rest to follow his example. After this the\n\nHellenes dismissed the guide with a present raised from the common\n\nstore, to wit, a horse, a silver bowl, a Persian dress, and ten\n\ndarics; but what he most begged to have were their rings, and of these\n\nhe got several from the soldiers. So, after pointing out to them a\n\nvillage where they would find quarters, and the road by which they\n\nwould proceed towards the land of the Macrones, as evening fell, he\n\nturned his back upon them in the night and was gone.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nVIII\n\n<br/><br/>\nFrom this point the Hellenes marched through the country of the         1\n\nMacrones three stages--ten parasangs, and on the first day they\n\nreached the river, which formed the boundary between the land of the\n\nMacrones and the land of the Scythenians. Above them, on their right,\n\nthey had a country of the sternest and ruggedest character, and on\n\ntheir left another river, into which the frontier river discharges\n\nitself, and which they must cross. This was thickly fringed with trees\n\nwhich, though not of any great bulk, were closely packed. As soon as\n\nthey came up to them, the Hellenes proceeded to cut them down in their\n", "haste to get out of the place as soon as possible. But the Macrones,\n\narmed with wicker shields and lances and hair tunics, were already\n\ndrawn up to receive them opposite the crossing. They were cheering one\n\nanother on, and kept up a steady pelt of stones into the river, though\n\nthey failed to reach the other side or do any harm.\n\n<br/><br/>\nAt this juncture one of the light infantry came up to Xenophon; he had\n\nbeen, he said, a slave at Athens, and he wished to tell him that he\n\nrecognised the speech of these people. \"I think,\" said he, \"that this\n\nmust be my native country, and if there is no objection I will have a\n\ntalk with them.\" \"No objection at all,\" replied Xenophon, \"pray talk    5\n\nto them, and ask them first, who they are.\" In answer to this question\n\nthey said, \"they were Macrones.\" \"Well, then,\" said he, \"ask them why\n\nthey are drawn up in battle and want to fight with us.\" They answered,\n\n\"Because you are invading our country.\" The generals bade him say: \"If\n\nso, it is with not intention certainly of doing it or you any harm:\n\nbut we have been at war with the king, and are now returning to\n\nHellas, and all we want is to reach the sea.\" The others asked, \"Were\n\nthey willing to give them pledges to that effect?\" They replied: \"Yes,\n\nthey were ready to give and receive pledges to that effect.\" Then the\n\nMacrones gave a barbaric lance to the Hellenes, and the Hellenes a\n\nHellenic lance to them: \"for these,\" they said, \"would serve as\n\npledges,\" and both sides called upon the gods to witness.\n\n<br/><br/>\nAfter the pledges were exchanged, the Macrones fell to vigorously\n\nhewing down trees and constructing a road to help them across,\n\nmingling freely with the Hellenes and fraternising in their midst, and\n\nthey afforded them as good as market as they could, and for three days\n\nconducted them on their march, until they had brought them safely to\n\nthe confines of the Colchians. At this point they were confronted by a\n", "great mountain chain, which however was accessible, and on it the\n\nColchians were drawn up for battle. In the first instance, the\n\nHellenes drew up opposite in line of battle, as though they were\n\nminded to assault the hill in that order; but afterwards the generals\n\ndetermined to hold a council of war, and consider how to make the\n\nfairest fight.\n\n<br/><br/>\nAccordingly Xenophon said: \"I am not for advancing in line, but advise\n\nto form companies by columns. To begin with, the line,\" he urged,\n\n\"would be scattered and thrown into disorder at once; for we shall\n\nfind the mountain full of inequalities, it will be pathless here and\n\neasy to traverse there. The mere fact of first having formed in line,\n\nand then seeing the line thrown into disorder, must exercise a\n\ndisheartening effect. Again, if we advance several deep, the enemy\n\nwill none the less overlap us, and turn their superfluous numbers to\n\naccount as best they like; while, if we march in shallow order, we may\n\nfully expect our line to be cut through and through by the thick rain   11\n\nof missiles and rush of men, and if this happen anywhere along the\n\nline, the whole line will equally suffer. No; my notion is to form\n\ncolumns by companies, covering ground sufficient with spaces between\n\nthe companies to allow the last companies of each flank to be outside\n\nthe enemy's flanks. Thus we shall with our extreme companies be\n\noutside the enemy's line, and the best men at the head of their\n\ncolumns will lead the attack, and every company will pick its way\n\nwhere the ground is easy; also it will be difficult for the enemy to\n\nforce his way into the intervening spaces, when there are companies on\n\nboth sides; nor will it be easy for him to cut in twain any individual\n\ncompany marching in column. If, too, any particular company should be\n\npressed, the neighbouring company will come to the rescue, or if at\n\nany point any single company succeed in reaching the height, from that\n", "moment not one man of the enemy will stand his ground.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nThis proposal was carried, and they formed into columns by\n\ncompanies (1). Then Xenophon, returning from the right wing to the\n\nleft, addressed the soldiers. \"Men,\" he said, \"these men whom you see\n\nin front of you are the sole obstacles still interposed between us and\n\nthe haven of our hopes so long deferred. We will swallow them up\n\nwhole, without cooking (2), if we can.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) For this formation, see \"The Retreat of the Ten Thousand; a\n\n    military study for all time,\" by Lieut.-General J. L. Vaughan,\n\n    C.B.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (2) Or, \"we will gobble them up raw.\" He is thinking of the Homeric\n\n    line (\"Iliad\", iv. 35) \"Perchance wert thou to enter within the\n\n    gates and long walls and devour Priam raw, and Priam's sons and\n\n    all the Trojans, then mightest thou assuage thine anger.\"--Leaf.\n\n<br/><br/>\nThe several divisions fell into position, the companies were formed\n\ninto columns, and the result was a total of something like eighty\n\ncompanies of heavy infantry, each company consisting on an average of\n\na hundred men. The light infantry and bowmen were arranged in three\n\ndivisions--two outside to support the left and the right respectively,\n\nand the third in the centre--each division consisting of about six\n\nhundred men (3).\n\n<br/><br/>\n (3) This suggests 1800 as the total of the peltasts, 8000 as the total\n\n    of the hoplites, but the companies were probably not limited to\n\n    100, and under \"peltasts\" were probably included other light\n\n    troops.\n", "<br/><br/>\nBefore starting, the generals passed the order to offer prayer; and     16\n\nwith the prayer and battle hymn rising from their lips they commenced\n\ntheir advance. Cheirisophus and Xenophon, and the light infantry with\n\nthem, advanced outside the enemy's line to right and left, and the\n\nenemy, seeing their advance, made an effort to keep parallel and\n\nconfront them, but in order to do so, as he extended partly to right\n\nand partly to left, he was pulled to pieces, and there was a large\n\nspace or hollow left in the centre of his line. Seeing them separate\n\nthus, the light infantry attached to the Arcadian battalion, under\n\ncommand of Aeschines, an Arcarnanian, mistook the movement for flight,\n\nand with a loud shout rushed on, and these were the first to scale the\n\nmountain summit; but they were closely followed up by the Arcadian\n\nheavy infantry, under command of Cleanor of Orchomenus.\n\n<br/><br/>\nWhen they began running in that way, the enemy stood their ground no\n\nlonger, but betook themselves to flight, one in one direction, one in\n\nanother, and the Hellenes scaled the hill and found quarters in\n\nnumerous villages which contained supplies in abundance. Here,\n\ngenerally speaking, there was nothing to excite their wonderment, but\n\nthe numbers of bee-hives were indeed astonishing, and so were certain\n\nproperties of the honey (4). The effect upon the soldiers who tasted\n\nthe combs was, that they all went for the nonce quite off their heads,\n\nand suffered from vomiting and diarrhoea, with a total inability to\n\nstand steady on their legs. A small dose produced a condition not\n\nunlike violent drunkenness, a large one an attack very like a fit of\n\nmadness, and some dropped down, apparently at death's door. So they\n\nlay, hundreds of them, as if there had been a great defeat, a prey to\n\nthe cruellest despondency. But the next day, none had died; and almost\n\nat the same hour of the day at which they had eaten they recovered\n", "their senses, and on the third or fourth day got on their legs again\n\nlike convalescents after a severe course of medical treatment.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (4) \"Modern travellers attest the existence, in these regions, of\n\n    honey intoxicating and poisonous.... They point out the Azalea\n\n    Pontica as the flower from which the bees imbibe this peculiar\n\n    quality.\"--Grote, \"Hist. of Greece,\" vol. ix. p. 155.\n\n<br/><br/>\nFrom this place they marched on two stages--seven parasangs--and        22\n\nreached the sea at Trapezus (5), a populous Hellenic city on the Euxine\n\nSea, a colony of the Sinopeans, in the territory of the Colchians.\n\nHere they halted about thirty days in the villages of the Colchians,\n\nwhich they used as a base of operations to ravage the whole territory\n\nof Colchis. The men of Trapezus supplied the army with a market,\n\nentertained them, and gave them, as gifts of hospitality, oxen and\n\nwheat and wine. Further, they negotiated with them in behalf of their\n\nneighbours the Colchians, who dwelt in the plain for the most part,\n\nand from this folk also came gifts of hospitality in the shape of\n\ncattle. And now the Hellenes made preparation for the sacrifice which\n\nthey had vowed, and a sufficient number of cattle came in for them to\n\noffer thank-offerings for safe guidance to Zeus the Saviour, and to\n\nHeracles (6), and to the other gods, according to their vows. They\n\ninstituted also a gymnastic contest on the mountain side, just where\n\nthey were quartered, and chose Dracontius, a Spartan (who had been\n\nbanished from home when a lad, having unintentionally slain another\n\nboy with a blow of his dagger), to superintend the course, and be\n\npresident of the games.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (5) Trebizond.\n\n<br/><br/>", " (6) Or, \"to sacrifice to Zeus the Preserver, and to Heracles\n\n    thank-offerings for safe guidance,\" Heracles \"the conductor\"\n\n    having special sympathy with wanderers.\n\n<br/><br/>\nAs soon as the sacrifices were over, they handed over the hides of the\n\nbeasts to Dracontius, and bade him lead the way to his racecourse. He\n\nmerely waved his hand and pointed to where they were standing, and\n\nsaid, \"There, this ridge is just the place for running, anywhere,\n\neverywhere.\" \"But how,\" it was asked, \"will they manage to wrestle on\n\nthe hard scrubby ground?\" \"Oh! worse knocks for those who are thrown,\"\n\nthe president replied. There was a mile race for boys, the majority\n\nbeing captive lads; and for the long race more than sixty Cretans\n\ncompeted; there was wrestling, boxing, and the pankration (7).\n\nAltogether it was a beautiful spectacle. There was a large number of\n\nentries, and the emulation, with their companions, male and female,     27\n\nstanding as spectators, was immense. There was horse-racing also; the\n\nriders had to gallop down a steep incline to the sea, and then turn\n\nand come up again to the altar, and on the descent more than half\n\nrolled head over heels, and then back they came toiling up the\n\ntremendous steep, scarcely out of a walking pace. Loud were the\n\nshouts, the laughter, and the cheers.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (7) The pankration combined both wrestling and boxing.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nBOOK V\n\n<br/><br/>", " (In the preceding portion of the narrative a detailed account\n\nis given of all that the Hellenes did, and how they fared on\n\nthe march up with Cyrus; and also of all that befell them on\n\ntheir march subsequently, until they reached the seaboard of\n\nthe Euxine Sea, or Pontus, and the Hellenic city of Trapezus,\n\nwhere they duly offered the sacrifice for safe deliverance\n\nwhich they had vowed to offer as soon as they set foot on a\n\nfriendly soil.)\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nI\n\n<br/><br/>\nAfter this they met and took counsel concerning the remainder of the    1\n\nmarch. The first speaker was Antileon of Thurii. He rose and said:\n\n\"For my part, sirs, I am weary by this time of getting kit together\n\nand packing up for a start, of walking and running and carrying heavy\n\narms, and of tramping along in line, or mounting guard, and doing\n\nbattle. The sole desire I now have is to cease from all these pains,\n\nand for the future, since here we have the sea before us, to sail on\n\nand on, 'stretched out in sleep,' like Odysseus, and so to find myself\n\nin Hellas.\" When they heard these remarks, the soldiers showed their\n\napproval with loud cries of \"well said,\" and then another spoke to the\n\nsame effect, and then another, and indeed all present. Then\n\nCheirisophus got up and said: \"I have a friend, sirs, who, as good hap\n\nwill have it, is now high admiral, Anaxibius. If you like to send me\n\nto him, I think I can safely promise to return with some men-of-war\n\nand other vessels which will carry us. All you have to do, if you are\n\nreally minded to go home by sea, is to wait here till I come. I will\n", "be back ere long.\" The soldiers were delighted at these words, and      4\n\nvoted that Cheirisophus should set sail on his mission without delay.\n\n<br/><br/>\nAfter him, Xenophon got up, and spoke as follows: \"Cheirisophus, it is\n\nagreed, sets out in search of vessels, and we are going to await him.\n\nLet me tell you what, in my opinion, it is reasonable to do while we\n\nare waiting. First of all, we must provide ourselves with necessaries\n\nfrom hostile territory, for there is not a sufficient market, nor, if\n\nthere were, have we, with a few solitary exceptions, the means of\n\npurchase. Now, the district is hostile, so that if you set off in\n\nsearch of provisions without care and precaution, the chances are that\n\nmany of us will be lost. To meet this risk, I propose that we should\n\norganise foraging parties to capture provisions, and, for the rest,\n\nnot roam about the country at random. The organisation of the matter\n\nshould be left to us.\" (The resolution was passed.) \"Please listen to\n\nanother proposal;\" he continued: \"Some of you, no doubt, will be going\n\nout to pillage. It will be best, I think, that whoever does so should\n\nin each case before starting inform us of his intent, and in what\n\ndirection he means to go, so that we may know the exact number of\n\nthose who are out and of those who stop behind. Thus we shall be able\n\nto help in preparing and starting the expedition where necessary; and\n\nin case of aid or reinforcements being called for, we shall know in\n\nwhat direction to proceed; or, again, if the attempt is to be\n\nundertaken by raw or less expert hands, we may throw in the weight of\n\nour experience and advice by endeavouring to discover the strength of\n\nthose whom they design to attack.\" This proposal was also carried.\n\n\"Here is another point,\" he continued, \"to which I would draw your\n\nattention. Our enemies will not lack leisure to make raids upon us:\n\nnor is it unnatural, that they should lay plots for us; for we have\n\nappropriated what is theirs; they are seated over us ever on the\n", "watch. I propose then that we should have regular outposts round the\n\ncamp. If we take it in succession to do picket and outlook duty, the\n\nenemy will be less able to harry us. And here is another point for\n\nyour observation; supposing we knew for certain that Cheirisophus must\n\nreturn with a sufficient number of vessels, there would be no need of   10\n\nthe remark, but as that is still problematical, I propose that we\n\nshould try to get together vessels on the spot also. If he comes and\n\nfinds us already provided for here, we shall have more ships than we\n\nneed, that is all; while, if he fails to bring them, we shall have the\n\nlocal supply to fall back upon. I see ships sailing past perpetually,\n\nso we have only to ask the loan of some war-ships from the men of\n\nTrapezus, and we can bring them into port, and safeguard them with\n\ntheir rudders unshipped, until we have enough to carry us. By this\n\ncourse I think we shall not fail of finding the means of transport\n\nrequisite.\" That resolution was also passed. He proceeded: \"Consider\n\nwhether you think it equitable to support by means of a general fund\n\nthe ships' companies which we so impress, while they wait here for our\n\nbenefit, and to agree upon a fare, on the principle of repaying\n\nkindnesses in kind.\" That too was passed. \"Well then,\" said he, \"in\n\ncase, after all, our endeavours should not be crowned with success,\n\nand we find that we have not vessels enough, I propose that we should\n\nenjoin on the cities along the seaboard the duty of constructing and\n\nputting in order the roads, which we hear are impassable. They will be\n\nonly too glad to obey, no doubt, out of mere terror and their desire\n\nto be rid of us.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nThis last proposal was met by loud cries and protestations against the\n\nidea of going by land at all. So, perceiving their infatuation, he did\n\nnot put the question to the vote, but eventually persuaded the cities\n\nvoluntarily to construct roads by the suggestion, \"If you get your\n", "roads in good order, we shall all the sooner be gone.\" They further\n\ngot a fifty-oared galley from the Trapezuntines, and gave the command\n\nof it to Dexippus, a Laconian, one of the perioeci (1). This man\n\naltogether neglected to collect vessels on the offing, but slunk off\n\nhimself, and vanished, ship and all, out of Pontus. Later on, however,\n\nhe paid the penalty of his misdeeds. He became involved in some\n\nmeddling and making in Thrace at the court of Seuthes, and was put to\n\ndeath by the Laconian Nicander. They also got a thirty-oared galley,\n\nthe command of which was entrusted to Polycrates, an Athenian, and      16\n\nthat officer brought into harbour to the camp all the vessels he could\n\nlay his hands on. If these were laden, they took out the freights and\n\nappointed guards to keep an eye on their preservation, whilst they\n\nused the ships themselves for transport service on the coast. While\n\nmatters stood at this point, the Hellenes used to make forays with\n\nvarying success; sometimes they captured prey and sometimes they\n\nfailed. On one occasion Cleanetus led his own and another company\n\nagainst a strong position, and was killed himself, with many others of\n\nhis party.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) A native of the country parts of Laconia.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nII\n\n<br/><br/>\nThe time came when it was no longer possible to capture provisions,     1\n\ngoing and returning to the camp in one day. In consequence of this,\n\nXenophon took some guides from the Trapezuntines and led half the army\n\nout against the Drilae, leaving the other half to guard the camp. That\n", "was necessary, since the Colchians, who had been ousted from their\n\nhouses, were assembled thickly, and sat eyeing them from the heights\n\nabove; on the other hand the Trapezuntines, being friendly to the\n\nnative inhabitants, were not for leading the Hellenes to places where\n\nit was easy to capture provisions. But against the Drilae, from whom\n\nthey personally suffered, they would lead them with enthusiasm, up\n\ninto mountainous and scarcely accessible fortresses, and against the\n\nmost warlike people of any in the Pontus.\n\n<br/><br/>\nBut when the Hellenes had reached the uplands, the Drilae set fire to\n\nall their fastnesses which they thought could be taken easily, and\n\nbeat a retreat; and except here and there a stray pig or bullock or\n\nother animal which had escaped the fire there was nothing to capture;\n\nbut there was one fastness which served as their metropolis: into this\n\nthe different streams of people collected; round it ran a tremendously\n\ndeep ravine, and the approaches to the place were difficult. So the\n\nlight infantry ran forward five or six furlongs in advance of the\n\nheavy infantry, and crossed the ravine; and seeing quantities of sheep\n\nand other things, proceeded to attack the place. Close at their heels\n\nfollowed a number of those who had set out on the foray armed with\n\nspears, so that the storming party across the ravine amounted to more\n\nthan two thousand. But, finding that they could not take the place by   5\n\na coup-de-main, as there was a trench running round it, mounded up\n\nsome breadth, with a stockade on the top of the earthwork and a\n\nclose-packed row of wooden bastions, they made an attempt to run back,\n\nbut the enemy fell upon them from the rear. To get away by a sudden\n\nrush was out of the question, since the descent from the fortress into\n\nthe ravine only admitted of moving in single file. Under the\n\ncircumstances they sent to Xenophon, who was in command of the heavy\n\ninfantry. The messenger came and delivered his message: \"There is a\n", "fastness choke full of all sorts of stores, but we cannot take it, it\n\nis too strong; nor can we easily get away; the enemy rush out and\n\ndeliver battle, and the return is difficult.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nOn hearing this, Xenophon pushed forward his heavy infantry to the\n\nedge of the ravine, and there ordered them to take up a position,\n\nwhile he himself with the officers crossed over to determine whether\n\nit were better to withdraw the party already across, or to bring over\n\nthe heavy infantry also, on the supposition that the fortress might be\n\ntaken. In favour of the latter opinion it was agreed that the retreat\n\nmust cost many lives, and the officers were further disposed to think,\n\nthey could take the place. Xenophon consented, relying on the victims,\n\nfor the seers had announced, that there would be a battle, but that\n\nthe result of the expedition would be good. So he sent the officers to\n\nbring the heavy troops across, while he himself remained, having drawn\n\noff all the light infantry and forbidden all sharp-shooting at long\n\nrange. As soon as the heavy infantry had arrived, he ordered each\n\ncaptain to form his company, in whatever way he hoped to make it most\n\neffective in the coming struggle. Side by side together they stood,\n\nthese captains, not for the first time to-day competitors for the\n\naward of manly virtue. While they were thus employed, he--the\n\ngeneral--was engaged in passing down his order along the ranks of the\n\nlight infantry and archers respectively to march with the javelin on\n\nits thong and the arrow to the string, ready at the word \"shoot\" to\n\ndischarge their missiles, while the light troops were to have their\n\nwallets well stocked with slingstones; lastly, he despatched his        12\n\nadjutants to see to the proper carrying out of these orders.\n\n<br/><br/>\nAnd now the preparations were complete: the officers and lieutenants\n\nand all others claiming to be peers of these, were drawn up in their\n", "several places. With a glance each was able to command the rest in the\n\ncrescent-like disposition which the ground invited. Presently the\n\nnotes of the battle hymn arose, the clarion spoke, and with a\n\nthrilling cry in honour of the warrior-god, commenced a rush of the\n\nheavy infantry at full speed under cover of a storm of missiles,\n\nlances, arrows, bullets, but most of all stones hurled from the hand\n\nwith ceaseless pelt, while there were some who brought firebrands to\n\nbear. Overwhelmed by this crowd of missiles, the enemy left their\n\nstockades and their bastion towers, which gave Agasias the Stymphalian\n\nand Philoxenus of Pellene a chance not to be missed; laying aside\n\ntheir heavy arms, up they went in bare tunics only, and one hauled\n\nanother up, and meantime another had mounted, and the place was taken,\n\nas they thought. Then the peltasts and light troops rushed in and\n\nbegan snatching what each man could. Xenophon the while, posted at the\n\ngates, kept back as many of the hoplites as he could, for there were\n\nother enemies now visible on certain strong citadel heights; and after\n\na lapse of no long time a shout arose within, and the men came running\n\nback, some still clutching what they had seized; and presently here\n\nand there a wounded man; and mighty was the jostling about the\n\nportals. To the questions which were put to them the outpouring\n\nfugitives repeated the same story: there was a citadel within and\n\nenemies in crowds were making savage sallies and beating the fellows\n\ninside.\n\n<br/><br/>\nAt that Xenophon ordered Tolmides the herald to proclaim: \"Enter all\n\nwho are minded to capture aught.\" In poured the surging multitude, and\n\nthe counter-current of persons elbowing their passage in prevailed\n\nover the stream of those who issued forth, until they beat back and\n\ncooped up the enemy within the citadel again. So outside the citadel\n\neverything was sacked and pillaged by the Hellenes, and the heavy\n", "infantry took up their position, some about the stockades, others       19\n\nalong the road leading up to the citadel. Xenophon and the officers\n\nmeantime considered the possibility of taking the citadel, for if so,\n\ntheir safety was assured; but if otherwise, it would be very difficult\n\nto get away. As the result of their deliberations they agreed that the\n\nplace was impregnable. Then they began making preparations for the\n\nretreat. Each set of men proceeded to pull down the palisading which\n\nfaced themselves; further, they sent away all who were useless or who\n\nhad enough to do to carry their burdens, with the mass of the heavy\n\ninfantry accompanying them; the officers in each case leaving behind\n\nmen whom they could severally depend on.\n\n<br/><br/>\nBut as soon as they began to retreat, out rushed upon them from within\n\na host of fellows, armed with wicker shields and lances, greaves and\n\nPaphlagonian helmets. Others might be seen scaling the houses on this\n\nside and that of the road leading into the citadel. Even pursuit in\n\nthe direction of the citadel was dangerous, since the enemy kept\n\nhurling down on them great beams from above, so that to stop and to\n\nmake off were alike dangerous, and night approaching was full of\n\nterrors. But in the midst of their fighting and their despair some god\n\ngave them a means of safety. All of a sudden, by whatsoever hand\n\nignited, a flame shot up; it came from a house on the right hand, and\n\nas this gradually fell in, the people from the other houses on the\n\nright took to their heels and fled.\n\n<br/><br/>\nXenophon, laying this lesson of fortune to heart, gave orders to set\n\nfire to the left-hand houses also, which being of wood burned quickly,\n\nwith the result that the occupants of these also took to flight. The\n\nmen immediately at their front were the sole annoyance now, and these\n\nwere safe to fall upon them as they made their exit and in their\n", "descent. Here then the word was passed for all who were out of range\n\nto bring up logs of wood and pile them between themselves and the\n\nenemy, and when there was enough of these they set them on fire; they\n\nalso fired the houses along the trench-work itself, so as to occupy\n\nthe attention of the enemy. Thus they got off, though with difficulty,\n\nand escaped from the place by putting a fire between them and the       27\n\nenemy; and the whole city was burnt down, houses, turrets, stockading,\n\nand everything belonging to it except the citadel.\n\n<br/><br/>\nNext day the Hellenes were bent on getting back with the provisions;\n\nbut as they dreaded the descent to Trapezus, which was precipitous and\n\nnarrow, they laid a false ambuscade, and a Mysian, called after the\n\nname of his nation (Mysus) (1), took ten of the Cretans and halted in\n\nsome thick brushy ground, where he made a feint of endeavouring to\n\nescape the notice of the enemy. The glint of their light shields,\n\nwhich were of brass, now and again gleamed through the brushwood. The\n\nenemy, seeing it all through the thicket, were confirmed in their\n\nfears of an ambuscade. But the army meanwhile was quietly making its\n\ndescent; and when it appeared that they had crept down far enough, the\n\nsignal was given to the Mysian to flee as fast as he could, and he,\n\nspringing up, fled with his men. The rest of the party, that is the\n\nCretans, saying, \"We are caught if we race,\" left the road and plunged\n\ninto a wood, and tumbling and rolling down the gullies were saved. The\n\nMysian, fleeing along the road, kept crying for assistance, which they\n\nsent him, and picked him up wounded. The party of rescue now beat a\n\nretreat themselves with their face to the foe, exposed to a shower of\n\nmissiles, to which some of the Cretan bowmen responded with their\n\narrows. In this way they all reached the camp in safety.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) Lit. \"{Musos} (Mysus), a Mysian by birth, and {Musos} (Mysus) by\n", "    name.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nIII\n\n<br/><br/>\nNow when Cheirisophus did not arrive, and the supply of ships was       1\n\ninsufficient, and to get provisions longer was impossible, they\n\nresolved to depart. On board the vessels they embarked the sick, and\n\nthose above forty years of age, with the boys and women, and all the\n\nbaggage which the solders were not absolutely forced to take for their\n\nown use. The two eldest generals, Philesius and Sophaenetus, were put\n\nin charge, and so the party embarked, while the rest resumed their\n\nmarch, for the road was now completely constructed. Continuing their\n\nmarch that day and the next, on the third they reached Cerasus, a\n\nHellenic city on the sea, and a colony of Sinope, in the country of\n\nthe Colchians. Here they halted ten days, and there was a review and\n\nnumbering of the troops under arms, when there were found to be eight   3\n\nthousand six hundred men. So many had escaped; the rest had perished\n\nat the hands of the enemy, or by reason of the snow, or else disease.\n\n<br/><br/>\nAt this time and place they divided the money accruing from the\n\ncaptives sold, and a tithe selected for Apollo and Artemis of the\n\nEphesians was divided between the generals, each of whom took a\n\nportion to guard for the gods, Neon the Asinaean (1) taking on behalf\n\nof Cheirisophus.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) I.e. of Asine, perhaps the place named in Thuc. iv. 13, 54; vi. 93\n\n    situated on the western side of the Messenian bay. Strabo,\n", "    however, speaks of another Asine near Gytheum, but possibly means\n\n    Las. See Arnold's note to Thuc. iv. 13, and Smith's \"Dict. Geog.\n\n    (s.v.)\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nOut of the portion which fell to Xenophon he caused a dedicatory\n\noffering to Apollo to be made and dedicated among the treasures of the\n\nAthenians at Delphi (2). It was inscribed with his own name and that of\n\nProxenus, his friend, who was killed with Clearchus. The gift for\n\nArtemis of the Ephesians was, in the first instance, left behind by\n\nhim in Asia at the time when he left that part of the world himself\n\nwith Agesilaus on the march into Boeotia (3). He left it behind in\n\ncharge of Megabyzus, the sacristan of the goddess, thinking that the\n\nvoyage on which he was starting was fraught with danger. In the event\n\nof his coming out of it alive, he charged Megabyzus to restore to him\n\nthe deposit; but should any evil happen to him, then he was to cause\n\nto be made and to dedicate on his behalf to Artemis, whatsoever thing\n\nhe thought would be pleasing to the goddess.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (2) Cf. Herod. i. 14; Strabo. ix. 420 for such private treasuries at\n\n    Delphi.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (3) I.e. in the year B.C. 394. The circumstances under which Agesilaus\n\n    was recalled from Asia, with the details of his march and the\n\n    battle of Coronea, are described by Xenophon in the fourth book of\n\n    the \"Hellenica.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nIn the days of his banishment, when Xenophon was now established by\n\nthe Lacedaemonians as a colonist in Scillus (4), a place which lies on   7\n\nthe main road to Olympia, Megabyzus arrived on his way to Olympia as a\n\nspectator to attend the games, and restored to him the deposit.\n", "Xenophon took the money and bought for the goddess a plot of ground at\n\na point indicated to him by the oracle. The plot, it so happened, had\n\nits own Selinus river flowing through it, just as at Ephesus the river\n\nSelinus flows past the temple of Artemis, and in both streams fish and\n\nmussels are to be found. On the estate at Scillus there is hunting and\n\nshooting of all the beasts of the chase that are.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (4) Scillus, a town of Triphylia, a district of Elis. In B.C. 572 the\n\n    Eleians had razed Pisa and Scillus to the ground. But between B.C.\n\n    392 and 387 the Lacedaemonians, having previously (B.C. 400,\n\n    \"Hell.\" III. ii. 30) compelled the Eleians to renounce their\n\n    supremacy over their dependent cities, colonised Scillus and\n\n    eventually gave it to Xenophon, then an exile from Athens.\n\n    Xenophon resided here from fifteen to twenty years, but was, it is\n\n    said, expelled from it by the Eleians soon after the battle of\n\n    Leuctra, in B.C. 371.--\"Dict. Geog. (s.v.)\" The site of the place,\n\n    and of Xenophon's temple, is supposed to be in the neighbourhood\n\n    of the modern village of Chrestena, or possibly nearer Mazi. To\n\n    reach Olympia, about 2 1/2 miles distant, one must cross the\n\n    Alpheus.\n\n<br/><br/>\nHere with the sacred money he built an altar and a temple, and ever\n\nafter, year by year, tithed the fruits of the land in their season and\n\ndid sacrifice to the goddess, while all the citizens and neighbours,\n\nmen and women, shared in the festival. The goddess herself provided\n\nfor the banqueters meat and loaves and wine and sweetmeats, with\n\nportions of the victims sacrificed from the sacred pasture, as also of\n\nthose which were slain in the chase; for Xenophon's own lads, with the\n\nlads of the other citizens, always made a hunting excursion against\n\nthe festival day, in which any grown men who liked might join. The\n", "game was captured partly from the sacred district itself, partly from\n\nPholoe (5), pigs and gazelles and stags. The place lies on the direct\n\nroad from Lacedaemon to Olympia, about twenty furlongs from the temple\n\nof Zeus in Olympia, and within the sacred enclosure there is\n\nmeadow-land and wood-covered hills, suited to the breeding of pigs and\n\ngoats and cattle and horses, so that even the sumpter animals of the\n\npilgrims passing to the feast fare sumptuously. The shrine is girdled\n\nby a grove of cultivated trees, yielding dessert fruits in their\n\nseason. The temple itself is a facsimile on a small scale of the great\n\ntemple at Ephesus, and the image of the goddess is like the golden\n\nstatue at Ephesus, save only that it is made, not of gold, but of\n\ncypress wood. Beside the temple stands a column bearing this\n\ninscription:--THE PLACE IS SACRED TO ARTEMIS. HE WHO HOLDS IT AND\n\nENJOYS THE FRUITS OF IT IS BOUND TO SACRIFICE YEARLY A TITHE OF THE     13\n\nPRODUCE. AND FROM THE RESIDUE THEREOF TO KEEP IN REPAIR THE SHRINE.

Geog.\" (Elis).\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nIV\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nFrom Cerasus they continued the march, the same portion of the troops   1\n", "being conveyed by sea as before, and the rest marching by land. When\n\nthey had reached the frontiers of the Mossynoecians (1) they sent to\n\nhim Timesitheus the Trapezuntine, who was the proxenos (2) of the\n\nMossynoecians, to inquire whether they were to pass through their\n\nterritory as friends or foes. They, trusting in their strongholds,\n\nreplied that they would not give them passage. It was then that\n\nTimesitheus informed them that the Mossynoecians on the farther side\n\nof the country were hostile to these members of the tribe; and it was\n\nresolved to invite the former to make an alliance, if they wished it.\n\nSo Timesitheus was sent, and came back with their chiefs. On their\n\narrival there was a conference of the Mossynoecian chiefs and the\n\ngenerals of the Hellenes, and Xenophon made a speech which Timesitheus\n\ninterpreted. He said: \"Men of the Mossynoecians, our desire is to\n\nreach Hellas in safety; and since we have no vessels we must needs go\n\nby foot, but these people who, as we hear, are your enemies, prevent\n\nus. Will you take us for your allies? Now is your chance to exact\n\nvengeance for any wrong, which they at any time may have put upon you,\n\nand for the future they will be your subjects; but if you send us\n\nabout our business, consider and ask yourselves from what quarter will\n\nyou ever again obtain so strong a force to help you?\" To this the\n\nchief of the Mossynoecians made answer:--that the proposal was in\n\naccordance with their wishes and they welcomed the alliance. \"Good,\"\n\nsaid Xenophon, \"but to what use do you propose to put us, if we become\n\nyour allies? And what will you in turn be able to do to assist our\n\npassage?\" They replied: \"We can make an incursion into this country\n\nhostile to yourselves and us, from the opposite side, and also send     10\n\nyou ships and men to this place, who will aid you in fighting and\n\nconduct you on the road.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) I.e. dwellers in mossyns, or wooden towers. See Herod. iii. 94;\n", "    vii. 78. Cf. also Strabo, xi. 41.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (2) Or, \"consul.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nOn this understanding, they exchanged pledges and were gone. The next\n\nday they returned, bringing three hundred canoes, each hollowed out of\n\na single trunk. There were three men in each, two of whom disembarked\n\nand fell into rank, whilst the third remained. Then the one set took\n\nthe boats and sailed back again, whilst the other two-thirds who\n\nremained marshalled themselves in the following way. They stood in\n\nrows of about a hundred each, like the rows of dancers in a chorus,\n\nstanding vis-a-vis to one another, and all bearing wicker shields,\n\nmade of white oxhide, shaggy, and shaped like an ivy leaf; in the\n\nright hand they brandished a javelin about six cubits long, with a\n\nlance in front, and rounded like a ball at the butt end of the shaft.\n\n<br/><br/>\nTheir bodies were clad in short frocks, scarcely reaching to the knees\n\nand in texture closely resembling that of a linen bedclothes' bag; on\n\ntheir heads they wore leathern helmets just like the Paphlagonian\n\nhelmet, with a tuft of hair in the middle, as like a tiara in shape as\n\npossible. They carried moreover iron battle-axes. Then one of them\n\ngave, as it were, the key-note and started, while the rest, taking up\n\nthe strain and the step, followed singing and marking time. Passing\n\nthrough the various corps and heavy armed battalions of the Hellenes,\n\nthey marched straight against the enemy, to what appeared the most\n\nassailable of his fortresses. It was situated in front of the city, or\n\nmother city, as it is called, which latter contains the high citadel\n\nof the Mossynoecians. This citadel was the real bone of contention,\n\nthe occupants at any time being acknowledged as the masters of all the\n\nother Mossynoecians. The present holders (so it was explained) had no\n", "right to its possession; for the sake of self-aggrandisement they had\n\nseized what was really common property.\n\n<br/><br/>\nSome of the Hellenes followed the attacking party, not under the\n\norders of the generals, but for the sake of plunder. As they advanced,\n\nthe enemy for a while kept quiet; but as they got near the place, they  16\n\nmade a sortie and routed them, killing several of the barbarians as\n\nwell as some of the Hellenes who had gone up with them; and so pursued\n\nthem until they saw the Hellenes advancing to the rescue. Then they\n\nturned round and made off, first cutting off the heads of the dead men\n\nand flaunting them in the face of the Hellenes and of their own\n\nprivate foes, dancing the while and singing in a measured strain. But\n\nthe Hellenes were much vexed to think that their foes had only been\n\nrendered bolder, while the Hellenes who had formed part of the\n\nexpedition had turned tail and fled, in spite of their numbers; a\n\nthing which had not happened previously during the whole expedition.\n\nSo Xenophon called a meeting of the Hellenes and spoke as follows:\n\n\"Soldiers, do not in any wise be cast down by what has happened, be\n\nsure that good no less than evil will be the result; for to begin\n\nwith, you now know certainly that those who are going to guide us are\n\nin very deed hostile to those with whom necessity drives us to\n\nquarrel; and, in the next place, some of our own body, these Hellenes\n\nwho have made so light of orderly array and conjoint action with\n\nourselves, as though they must needs achieve in the company of\n\nbarbarians all they could with ourselves, have paid the penalty and\n\nbeen taught a lesson, so that another time they will be less prone to\n\nleave our ranks. But you must be prepared to show these friendly\n\nbarbarians that you are of a better sort, and prove to the enemy that\n\nbattle with the undisciplined is one thing, but with men like\n\nyourselves another.\"\n", "<br/><br/>\nAccordingly they halted, as they were, that day. Next day they\n\nsacrificed and finding the victims favourable, they breakfasted,\n\nformed the companies into columns, and with their barbarians arranged\n\nin similar order on their left, began their march. Between the\n\ncompanies were the archers only slightly retired behind the front of\n\nthe heavy infantry, on account of the enemy's active light troops, who\n\nran down and kept up volleys of stones. These were held in check by\n\nthe archers and peltasts; and steadily step by step the mass marched\n\non, first to the position from which the barbarians and those with\n\nthem had been driven two days back, and where the enemy were now drawn  23\n\nup to meet them. Thus it came to pass that the barbarians first\n\ngrappled with the peltasts and maintained the battle until the heavy\n\ninfantry were close, when they turned and fled. The peltasts followed\n\nwithout delay, and pursued them right up to their city, while the\n\nheavy troops in unbroken order followed. As soon as they were up at\n\nthe houses of the capital, there and then the enemy, collecting all\n\ntogether in one strong body, fought valiantly, and hurled their\n\njavelins, or else clenched their long stout spears, almost too heavy\n\nfor a man to wield, and did their best to ward off the attack at close\n\nquarters.\n\n<br/><br/>\nBut when the Hellenes, instead of giving way, kept massing together\n\nmore thickly, the barbarians fled from this place also, and in a body\n\ndeserted the fortress. Their king, who sat in his wooden tower or\n\nmossyn, built on the citadel (there he sits and there they maintain\n\nhim, all at the common cost, and guard him narrowly), refused to come\n\nforth, as did also those in the fortress first taken, and so were\n\nburnt to a cinder where they were, their mossyns, themselves, and all.\n\nThe Hellenes, pillaging and ransacking these places, discovered in the\n", "different houses treasures and magazines of loaves, pile upon pile,\n\n\"the ancestral stores,\" as the Mossynoecians told them; but the new\n\ncorn was laid up apart with the straw-stalk and ear together, and this\n\nwas for the most part spelt. Slices of dolphin were another discovery,\n\nin narrow-necked jars, all properly salted and pickled; and there was\n\nblubber of dolphin in vessels, which the Mossynoecians used precisely\n\nas the Hellenes use oil. Then there were large stores of nuts on the\n\nupper floor, the broad kind without a division (3). This was also a\n\nchief article of food with them--boiled nuts and baked loaves. Wine\n\nwas also discovered. This, from its rough, dry quality, tasted sharp\n\nwhen drunk pure, but mixed with water was sweet and fragrant.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (3) I.e. \"chestnuts.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nThe Hellenes breakfasted and then started forward on their march,\n\nhaving first delivered the stronghold to their allies among the\n\nMossynoecians. As for the other strongholds belonging to tribes allied\n\nwith their foes, which they passed en route, the most accessible were\n\neither deserted by their inhabitants or gave in their adhesion          30\n\nvoluntarily. The following description will apply to the majority of\n\nthem: the cities were on an average ten miles apart, some more, some\n\nless; but so elevated is the country and intersected by such deep\n\nclefts that if they chose to shout across to one another, their cries\n\nwould be heard from one city to another. When, in the course of their\n\nmarch, they came upon a friendly population, these would entertain\n\nthem with exhibitions of fatted children belonging to the wealthy\n\nclasses, fed up on boiled chestnuts until they were as white as white\n\ncan be, of skin plump and delicate, and very nearly as broad as they\n\nwere long, with their backs variegated and their breasts tattooed with\n\npatterns of all sorts of flowers. They sought after the women in the\n", "Hellenic army, and would fain have laid with them openly in broad\n\ndaylight, for that was their custom. The whole community, male and\n\nfemale alike, were fair-complexioned and white-skinned.\n\n<br/><br/>\nIt was agreed that this was the most barbaric and outlandish people\n\nthat they had passed through on the whole expedition, and the furthest\n\nremoved from the Hellenic customs, doing in a crowd precisely what\n\nother people would prefer to do in solitude, and when alone behaving\n\nexactly as others would behave in company, talking to themselves and\n\nlaughing at their own expense, standing still and then again capering\n\nabout, wherever they might chance to be, without rhyme or reason, as\n\nif their sole business were to show off to the rest of the world.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nV\n\n<br/><br/>\nThrough this country, friendly or hostile as the chance might be, the   1\n\nHellenes marched, eight stages in all, and reached the Chalybes. These\n\nwere a people few in number, and subject to the Mossynoecians. Their\n\nlivelihood was for the most part derived from mining and forging iron.\n\n<br/><br/>\nThence they came to the Tibarenians. The country of the Tibarenians\n\nwas far more level, and their fortresses lay on the seaboard and were\n\nless strong, whether by art or nature. The generals wanted to attack\n\nthese places, so that the army might get some pickings, and they would\n\nnot accept the gifts of hospitality which came in from the              2\n\nTibarenians, but bidding them wait till they had taken counsel, they\n\nproceeded to offer sacrifice. After several abortive attempts, the\n", "seers at last pronounced an opinion that the gods in no wise\n\ncountenanced war. Then they accepted the gifts of hospitality, and\n\nmarching through what was now recognised as a friendly country, in two\n\ndays reached Cotyora, a Hellenic city, and a colony of Sinope, albeit\n\nsituated in the territory of the Tibarenians (1).\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) The MSS. here read, \"Up to this point the expedition was conducted\n\n    on land, and the distance traversed on foot from the battle-field\n\n    near Babylon down to Cotyora amounted to one hundred and\n\n    twenty-two stages--that is to say, six hundred and twenty\n\n    parasangs, or eighteen thousand stades, or if measured in time, an\n\n    eight months' march.\" The words are probably the note of some\n\n    editor or commentator, though it is quite likely that the author\n\n    himself may have gone through such calculations and even have\n\n    inserted them as a note to his text.\n\n<br/><br/>\nHere they halted forty-five days, during which they first of all\n\nsacrificed to the gods, and instituted processions, each set of the\n\nHellenes according to their several tribes, with gymnastic contests.\n\nProvisions they got in meanwhile, partly from Paphlagonia, partly from\n\nthe estates of the Cotyorites, for the latter would neither provide\n\nthem a market nor receive their sick within their walls.\n\n<br/><br/>\nMeanwhile ambassadors arrived from Sinope, full of fears, not only for\n\nthe Cotyorites and their city, which belonged to Sinope, and brought\n\nin tribute, but also for the territory which, as they had heard, was\n\nbeing pillaged. Accordingly they came to the camp and made a speech.\n\nHecatonymus, who was reported to be a clever orator, acted as their\n\nspokesman: \"Soldiers,\" he said, \"the city of the Sinopeans has sent us\n\nto offer you, as Hellenes, our compliments and congratulations on your\n", "victories over the barbarians; and next, to express our joyful\n\nsatisfaction that you have surmounted all those terrible sufferings of\n\nwhich we have heard, and have reached this place in safety. As\n\nHellenes we claim to receive at your hands, as fellow-Hellenes,\n\nkindness and not harm. We have certainly not ourselves set you an\n\nexample heretofore of evil treatment. Now the Cotyorites are our\n\ncolonists. It was we who gave them this country to dwell in, having     10\n\ntaken it from the barbarians; for which reason also they, with the men\n\nof Cerasus and Trapezus, pay us an appointed tribute. So that,\n\nwhatever mischief you inflict on the men of Cotyora, the city of\n\nSinope takes as personal to herself. At the present time we hear that\n\nyou have made forcible entry into their city, some of you, and are\n\nquartered in the houses, besides taking forcibly from the Cotyorite\n\nestates whatever you need, by hook and by crook. Now against these\n\nthings we enter protest. If you mean to go on so doing, you will drive\n\nus to make friends with Corylas and the Paphlagonians, or any one else\n\nwe can find.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nTo meet these charges Xenophon, on behalf of the soldiers, rose and\n\nsaid: \"As to ourselves, men of Sinope, having got so far, we are well\n\ncontent to have saved our bodies and our arms. Indeed it was\n\nimpossible at one and the same moment to keep our enemies at bay and\n\nto despoil them of their goods and chattels. And now, since we have\n\nreached Hellenic cities, how has it fared with us? At Trapezus they\n\ngave us a market, and we paid for our provisions at a fair market\n\nprice. In return for the honour they did us, and the gifts of\n\nhospitality they gave the army, we requited them with honour. Where\n\nthe barbarian was friendly to them, we stayed our hands from injury;\n\nor under their escort, we did damage to their enemies to the utmost of\n\nour power. Ask them, what sort of people they found us. They are here,\n", "some of them, to answer for themselves. Their fellow-citizens and the\n\nstate of Trapezus, for friendship's sake, have sent them with us to\n\nact as our guides.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"But wherever we come, be it foreign or Hellenic soil, and find no\n\nmarket for provisions, we are wont to help ourselves, not out of\n\ninsolence but from necessity. There have been tribes like the\n\nCarduchians, the Taochians, the Chaldaeans, which, albeit they were\n\nnot subject to the great king, yet were no less formidable than\n\nindependent. These we had to bring over by our arms. The necessity of\n\ngetting provisions forced us; since they refused to offer us a market.\n\nWhereas some other folk, like the Macrones, in spite of their being\n\nbarbarians, we regarded as our friends, simply because they did\n\nprovide us with the best market in their power, and we took no single   18\n\nthing of theirs by force. But, to come to these Cotyorites, whom you\n\nclaim to be your people, if we have taken aught from them, they have\n\nthemselves to blame, for they did not deal with us as friends, but\n\nshut their gates in our faces. They would neither welcome us within\n\nnor furnish us with a market without. The only justification they\n\nalleged was that your governor (2) had authorised this conduct.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (2) Lit. \"harmost\". The term, denoting properly a governor of the\n\n    islands and foreign cities sent out by the Lacedaemonians during\n\n    their supremacy, came, it would seem, to be adopted by other Greek\n\n    communities under somewhat similar circumstances. Cotyora receives\n\n    a harmost from her mother-city, Sinope. For the Greek colonies\n\n    here mentioned, see Kiepert's \"Man. Anct. Geog.\" (Engl. tr., Mr.\n\n    G. A. Macmillan), p. 63.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"As to your assertion,\" he continued, turning to Hecatonymus, \"that we\n", "have got in by force and have taken up quarters, this is what we did.\n\nWe requested them to receive our sick and wounded under cover; and\n\nwhen they refused to open their gates, we walked in where the place\n\nitself invited us. All the violence we have committed amounts to this,\n\nthat our sick folk are quartered under cover, paying for their\n\nexpenses, and we keep a sentry at the gates, so that our sick and\n\nwounded may not lie at the mercy of your governor, but we may have it\n\nin our power to remove them whenever we like. The rest of us, you\n\nobserve, are camping under the canopy of heaven, in regular rank and\n\nfile, and we are ready to requite kindness with kindness, but to repel\n\nevil vigorously. And as for your threat,\" he said, once again turning\n\nto the spokesman, \"that you will, if it suits you, make alliance with\n\nCorylas and the Paphlagonians to attack us, for our part, we have no\n\nobjection to fighting both sets of you, if so be we must; we have\n\nalready fought others many times more numerous than you. Besides, 'if\n\nit suits us,' as you put it, to make the Paphlagonian our friend\n\n(report says that he has a hankering after your city and some other\n\nplaces on the seaboard), we can enhance the value of our friendship by\n\nhelping to win for him what he covets.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nThereupon the ambassadors showed very plainly their annoyance with\n\nHecatonymus, on account of the style of his remarks, and one of them\n\nstept forward to explain that their intention in coming was not at all\n\nto raise a war, but on the contrary to demonstrate their friendliness.  24\n\n\"And if you come to Sinope itself,\" the speaker continued, \"we will\n\nwelcome you there with gifts of hospitality. Meanwhile we will enjoin\n\nupon the citizens of this place to give you what they can; for we can\n\nsee that every word of what you say is true.\" Thereupon the Cotyorites\n\nsent gifts of hospitality, and the generals of the Hellenes\n\nentertained the ambassadors of the Sinopeans. Many and friendly were\n", "the topics of conversation; freely flowed the talk on things in\n\ngeneral; and, in particular, both parties were able to make inquiries\n\nand satisfy their curiosity concerning the remaining portion of the\n\nmarch.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nVI\n\n<br/><br/>\nSuch was the conclusion of that day. On the following day the generals  1\n\nsummoned an assembly of the soldiers, when it was resolved to invite\n\nthe men of Sinope, and to take advice with them touching the remainder\n\nof the journey. In the event of their having to continue it on foot,\n\nthe Sinopeans through their acquaintance with Paphlagonia would be\n\nuseful to them; while, if they had to go by sea, the services of the\n\nsame people would be at a premium; for who but they could furnish\n\nships sufficient for the army? Accordingly, they summoned their\n\nambassadors, and took counsel with them, begging them, on the strength\n\nof the sacred ties which bind Hellenes to Hellenes, to inaugurate the\n\ngood reception they had spoken of, by present kindliness and their\n\nbest advice.\n\n<br/><br/>\nHecatonymus rose and wished at once to offer an apology with regard to\n\nwhat he had said about the possibility of making friends with the\n\nPaphlagonians. \"The words were not intended,\" he said, \"to convey a\n\nthreat, as though they were minded to go to war with the Hellenes, but\n\nas meaning rather: albeit we have it in our power to be friendly with\n\nthe barbarians, we will choose the Hellenes.\" Then, being urged to aid\n\nthem by some advice, with a pious ejaculation, he commenced: \"If I\n", "bestow upon you the best counsel I am able, God grant that blessings\n\nin abundance may descend on me; but if the contrary, may evil betide    4\n\nme! 'Sacred counsel (1),' as the saying goes--well, sirs, if ever the\n\nsaying held, it should hold I think to-day; when, if I be proved to\n\nhave given you good counsel, I shall not lack panegyrists, or if evil,\n\nyour imprecations will be many-tongued.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) Cf. Plato, \"Theages,\" 122.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"As to trouble, I am quite aware, we shall have much more trouble if\n\nyou are conveyed by sea, for we must provide the vessels; whereas, if\n\nyou go by land, all the fighting will evolve on you. Still, let come\n\nwhat may, it behoves me to state my views. I have an intimate\n\nacquaintance with the country of the Paphlagonians and their power.\n\nThe country possesses the two features of hill and vale, that is to\n\nsay, the fairest plains and the highest mountains. To begin with the\n\nmountains, I know the exact point at which you must make your entry.\n\nIt is precisely where the horns of a mountain tower over both sides of\n\nthe road. Let the merest handful of men occupy these and they can hold\n\nthe pass with ease; for when that is done not all the enemies in the\n\nworld could effect a passage. I could point out the whole with my\n\nfinger, if you like to send any one with me to the scene.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"So much for the mountain barrier. But the next thing I know is that\n\nthere are plains and a cavalry which the barbarians themselves hold to\n\nbe superior to the entire cavalry of the great king. Why, only the\n\nother day these people refused to present themselves to the summons of\n\nthe king; their chief is too proud for that.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"But now, supposing you were able to seize the mountain barrier, by\n", "stealth, or expedition, before the enemy could stop you; supposing\n\nfurther, you were able to win an engagement in the plain against not\n\nonly their cavalry but their more than one hundred and twenty thousand\n\ninfantry--you will only find yourself face to face with rivers, a\n\nseries of them. First the Thermodon, three hundred feet broad, which I\n\ntake it will be difficult to pass, especially with a host of foes in\n\nfront and another following behind. Next comes the Iris river, three\n\nhundred feet broad; and thirdly, the Halys, at least two furlongs\n\nbroad, which you could not possibly cross without vessels, and who is\n\ngoing to supply you with vessels? In the same way too the Parthenius    9\n\nis impassable, which you will reach if you cross the Halys. For my\n\npart, then, I consider the land-journey, I will not say difficult, but\n\nabsolutely impossible for you. Whereas if you go by sea, you can coast\n\nalong from here to Sinope, and from Sinope to Heraclea. From Heraclea\n\nonwards there is no difficulty, whether by land or by sea; for there\n\nare plenty of vessels at Heraclea.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nAfter he had finished his remarks, some of his hearers thought they\n\ndetected a certain bias in them. He would not have spoken so, but for\n\nhis friendship with Corylas, whose official representative he was.\n\nOthers guessed he had an itching palm, and that he was hoping to\n\nreceive a present for his \"sacred advice.\" Others again suspected that\n\nhis object was to prevent their going by foot and doing some mischief\n\nto the country of the Sinopeans. However that might be, the Hellenes\n\nvoted in favour of continuing the journey by sea. After this Xenophon\n\nsaid: \"Sinopeans, the army has chosen that method of procedure which\n\nyou advise, and thus the matter stands. If there are sure to be\n\nvessels enough to make it impossible for a single man to be left\n\nbehind, go by sea we will; but if part of us are to be left while part\n\ngo by sea, we will not set foot on board the vessels. One fact we\n", "plainly recognise, strength is everything to us. So long as we have\n\nthe mastery, we shall be able to protect ourselves and get provisions;\n\nbut if we are once caught at the mercy of our foes, it is plain, we\n\nshall be reduced to slavery.\" On hearing this the ambassadors bade\n\nthem send an embassy, which they did, to wit, Callimachus the\n\nArcadian, and Ariston the Athenian, and Samolas the Achaean.\n\n<br/><br/>\nSo these set off, but meanwhile a thought shaped itself in the mind of\n\nXenophon, as there before his eyes lay that vast army of Hellene\n\nhoplites, and that other array of peltasts, archers, and slingers,\n\nwith cavalry to boot, and all in a state of thorough efficiency from\n\nlong practice, hardened veterans, and all collected in Pontus, where\n\nto raise so large a force would cost a mint of money. Then the idea\n\ndawned upon him: how noble an opportunity to acquire new territory and  15\n\npower for Hellas, by the founding of a colony--a city of no mean size,\n\nmoreover, said he to himself, as he reckoned up their own numbers--and\n\nbesides themselves a population planted on the shores of Pontus.\n\nThereupon he summoned Silanus the Ambraciot, the soothsayer of Cyrus\n\nabove mentioned, and before breathing a syllable to any of the\n\nsoldiers, he consulted the victims by sacrifice.\n\n<br/><br/>\nBut Silanus, in apprehension lest these ideas might embody themselves,\n\nand the army be permanently halted at some point or other, set a tale\n\ngoing among the men, to the effect that Xenophon was minded to detain\n\nthe army and found a city in order to win himself a name and acquire\n\npower, Silanus himself being minded to reach Hellas with all possible\n\nspeed, for the simple reason that he had still got the three thousand\n\ndarics presented to him by Cyrus on the occasion of the sacrifice when\n\nhe hit the truth so happily about the ten days. Silanus's story was\n\nvariously received, some few of the soldiers thinking it would be an\n", "excellent thing to stay in that country; but the majority were\n\nstrongly averse. The next incident was that Timasion the Dardanian,\n\nwith Thorax the Boeotian, addressed themselves to some Heracleot and\n\nSinopean traders who had come to Cotyora, and told them that if they\n\ndid not find means to furnish the army with pay sufficient to keep\n\nthem in provisions on the homeward voyage, all that great force would\n\nmost likely settle down permanently in Pontus. \"Xenophon has a pet\n\nidea,\" they continued, \"which he urges upon us. We are to wait until\n\nthe ships come, and then we are suddenly to turn round to the army and\n\nsay: 'Soldiers, we now see the straits we are in, unable to keep\n\nourselves in provisions on the return voyage, or to make our friends\n\nat home a little present at the end of our journey. But if you like to\n\nselect some place on the inhabited seaboard of the Black Sea which may\n\ntake your fancy and there put in, this is open to you to do. Those who\n\nlike to go home, go; those who care to stay here, stay. You have got    20\n\nvessels now, so that you can make a sudden pounce upon any point you\n\nchoose.'\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nThe merchants went off with this tale and reported it to every city\n\nthey came to in turn, nor did they go alone, but Timasion the\n\nDardanian sent a fellow-citizen of his own, Eurymachus, with the\n\nBoeotian Thorax, to repeat the same story. So when it reached the ears\n\nof the men of Sinope and the Heracleots, they sent to Timasion and\n\npressed him to accept of a gratuity, in return for which he was to\n\narrange for the departure of the troops. Timasion was only too glad to\n\nhear this, and he took the opportunity when the soldiers were convened\n\nin meeting to make the following remarks: \"Soldiers,\" he said, \"do not\n\nset your thoughts on staying here; let Hellas, and Hellas only, be the\n\nobject of your affection, for I am told that certain persons have been\n\nsacrificing on this very question, without saying a word to you. Now I\n", "can promise you, if you once leave these waters, to furnish you with\n\nregular monthly pay, dating from the first of the month, at the rate\n\nof one cyzicene (2) a head per month. I will bring you to the Troad,\n\nfrom which part I am an exile, and my own state is at your service.\n\nThey will receive me with open arms. I will be your guide personally,\n\nand I will take you to places where you will get plenty of money. I\n\nknow every corner of the Aeolid, and Phrygia, and the Troad, and\n\nindeed the whole satrapy of Pharnabazus, partly because it is my\n\nbirthplace, partly from campaigns in that region with Clearchus and\n\nDercylidas (3).\"\n\n<br/><br/>\n (2) A cyzicene stater = twenty-eight silver drachmae of Attic money\n\n    B.C. 335, in the time of Demosthenes; but, like the daric, this\n\n    gold coin would fluctuate in value relatively to silver. It\n\n    contained more grains of gold than the daric.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (3) Of Dercylidas we hear more in the \"Hellenica.\" In B.C. 411 he was\n\n    harmost at Abydos; in B.C. 399 he superseded Thimbron in Asia\n\n    Minor; and was himself superseded by Agesilaus in B.C. 396.\n\n<br/><br/>\nNo sooner had he ceased than up got Thorax the Boeotian. This was a\n\nman who had a standing battle with Xenophon about the generalship of\n\nthe army. What he said was that, if they once got fairly out of the\n\nEuxine, there was the Chersonese, a beautiful and prosperous country,\n\nwhere they could settle or not, as they chose. Those who liked could\n\nstay; and those who liked could return to their homes; how ridiculous   25\n\nthen, when there was so much territory in Hellas and to spare, to be\n\npoking about (4) in the land of the barbarian. \"But until you find\n\nyourselves there,\" he added, \"I, no less than Timasion, can guarantee\n\nyou regular pay.\" This he said, knowing what promises had been made\n", "Timasion by the men of Heraclea and Sinope to induce them to set sail.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (4) The word {masteuein} occurs above, and again below, and in other\n\n    writings of our author. It is probably Ionic or old Attic, and\n\n    occurs in poetry.\n\n<br/><br/>\nMeanwhile Xenophon held his peace. Then up got Philesius and Lycon,\n\ntwo Achaeans: \"It was monstrous,\" they said, \"that Xenophon should be\n\nprivately persuading people to stop there, and consulting the victims\n\nfor that end, without letting the army into the secret, or breathing a\n\nsyllable in public about the matter.\" When it came to this, Xenophon\n\nwas forced to get up, and speak as follows: \"Sirs, you are well aware\n\nthat my habit is to sacrifice at all times; whether in your own behalf\n\nor my own, I strive in every thought, word, and deed to be directed as\n\nis best for yourselves and for me. And in the present instance my sole\n\nobject was to learn whether it were better even so much as to broach\n\nthe subject, and so take action, or to have absolutely nothing to do\n\nwith the project. Now Silanus the soothsayer assured me by his answer\n\nof what was the main point: 'the victims were favourable.' No doubt\n\nSilanus knew that I was not unversed myself in his lore, as I have so\n\noften assisted at the sacrifice; but he added that there were symptoms\n\nin the victims of some guile or conspiracy against me. That was a\n\nhappy discovery on his part, seeing that he was himself conspiring at\n\nthe moment to traduce me before you; since it was he who set the tale\n\ngoing that I had actually made up my mind to carry out these projects\n\nwithout procuring your consent. Now, for my part, if I saw that you     30\n\nwere in any difficulties, I should set myself to discover how you\n\nmight capture a city, on the understanding of course that all who\n\nwished might sail away at once, leaving those who did not wish, to\n\nfollow at a later date, with something perhaps in their pockets to\n", "benefit their friends at home. Now, however, as I see that the men of\n\nHeraclea and Sinope are to send you ships to assist you to sail away,\n\nand more than one person guarantees to give you regular monthly pay,\n\nit is, I admit, a rare chance to be safely piloted to the haven of our\n\nhopes, and at the same time to receive pay for our preservation. For\n\nmyself I have done with that dream, and to those, who came to me to\n\nurge these projects, my advice is to have done with them. In fact,\n\nthis is my view. As long as you stay together united as to-day, you\n\nwill command respect and procure provisions; for might certainly\n\nexercises a right over what belongs to the weaker. But once broken up,\n\nwith your force split into bits, you will neither be able to get\n\nsubsistence, nor indeed will you get off without paying dearly for it.\n\nIn fact, my resolution coincides precisely with yours. It is that we\n\nshould set off for Hellas, and if any one stops behind, or is caught\n\ndeserting before the whole army is in safety, let him be judged as an\n\nevil-doer. Pray let all who are in favour of this proposition hold up\n\ntheir hands.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nThey all held them up; only Silanus began shouting and vainly striving\n\nto maintain the right of departure for all who liked to depart. But\n\nthe soldiers would not suffer him, threatening him that if he were\n\nhimself caught attempting to run away they would inflict the aforesaid\n\npenalty. After this, when the Heracleots learned that the departure by\n\nsea was resolved upon, and that the measure itself emanated from\n\nXenophon, they sent the vessels indeed; but as to the money which they\n\nhad promised to Timasion and Thorax as pay for the soldiers, they were\n\nnot as good as their word, in fact they cheated them both. Thus the\n\ntwo who had guaranteed regular monthly pay were utterly confounded,\n\nand stood in terror of the soldiers. What they did then, was to take\n\nto them the other generals to whom they had communicated their former\n", "transactions (that is to say, all except Neon the Asniaean, who, as\n\nlieutenant-general, was acting for Cheirisophus during his continued\n\nabsence). This done they came in a body to Xenophon and said that       36\n\ntheir views were changed. As they had now got the ships, they thought\n\nit best to sail to the Phasis, and seize the territory of the Phasians\n\n(whose present king was a descendant of Aeetes (5)). Xenophon's reply\n\nwas curt:--Not one syllable would he have to say himself to the army\n\nin this matter, \"But,\" he added, \"if you like, you can summon an\n\nassembly and have your say.\" Thereupon Timasion the Dardanian set\n\nforth as his opinion:--It were best to hold no parliament at present,\n\nbut first to go and conciliate, each of them, his own officers. Thus\n\nthey went away and proceeded to execute their plans.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (5) Aeetes is the patronym of the kings of Colchis from mythical times\n\n    onwards; e.g. Medea was the daughter of Aeetes.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nVII\n\n<br/><br/>\nPresently the soldiers came to learn what was in course of agitation,   1\n\nand Neon gave out that Xenophon had persuaded the other generals to\n\nadopt his views, and had a plan to cheat the soldiers and take them\n\nback to the Phasis. The soldiers were highly indignant; meetings were\n\nheld; little groups gathered ominously; and there seemed an alarming\n\nprobability that they would repeat the violence with which they had\n\nlately treated the heralds of the Colchians and the clerks of the\n\nmarket; when all who did not save themselves by jumping into the sea\n\nwere stoned to death. So Xenophon, seeing what a storm was brewing,\n", "resolved to anticipate matters so far as to summon a meeting of the\n\nmen without delay, and thus prevent their collecting of their own\n\naccord, and he ordered the herald to announce an assembly. The voice\n\nof the herald was no sooner heard than they rushed with great\n\nreadiness to the place of meeting. Then Xenophon, without accusing the\n\ngenerals of having come to him, made the following speech: \"I hear\n\nthat a charge is brought against me. It is I apparently who am going\n\nto cheat you and carry you off to Phasis. I beg you by all that is\n\nholy to listen to me; and if there be found any guilt in me, let me\n\nnot leave this place till I have paid the penalty of my misdoing; but\n\nif my accusers are found guilty, treat them as they deserve. I\n\npresume, sirs, you know where the sun rises and where he sets, and\n\nthat he who would go to Hellas must needs journey towards the sunset;\n\nwhereas he who seeks the land of the barbarian must contrariwise fix    6\n\nhis face towards the dawn. Now is that a point in which a man might\n\nhope to cheat you? Could any one make you believe that the sun rises\n\nhere and sets there, or that he sets here and rises there? And\n\ndoubtless you know this too, that it is Boreas, the north wind, who\n\nbears the mariner out of Pontus towards Hellas, and the south wind\n\ninwards towards the Phasis, whence the saying--\n\n<br/><br/>\n      \"'When the North wind doth blow\n\n        Home to Hellas we will go (1).'\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) Whether this was a local saying or a proverb I cannot say. The\n\n    words have a poetical ring about them: \"When Borrhas blows, fair\n\n    voyages to Hellas.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"He would be a clever fellow who could befool you into embarking with\n\na south wind blowing. That sounds all very well, you think, only I may\n", "get you on board during a calm. Granted, but I shall be on board my\n\none ship, and you on board another hundred at least, and how am I to\n\nconstrain you to voyage with me against your will, or by what cajolery\n\nshall I carry you off? But I will imagine you so far befooled and\n\nbewitched by me, that I have got you to the Phasis; we proceed to\n\ndisembark on dry land. At last it will come out, that wherever you\n\nare, you are not in Hellas, and the inventor of the trick will be one\n\nsole man, and you who have been caught by it will number something\n\nlike ten thousand with swords in your hands. I do not know how a man\n\ncould better ensure his own punishment than by embarking on such a\n\npolicy with regards to himself and you.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"Nay, these tales are the invention of silly fellows who are jealous\n\nof the honour you bestow on me. A most uncalled-for jealousy! Do I\n\nhinder any of them from speaking any word of import in his power? of\n\nstriking a blow in your behalf and his own, if that is his choice? or,\n\nfinally, of keeping his eyes and ears open to secure your safety? What\n\nis it? In your choice of leaders do I stand in the way of any one, is\n\nthat it? Let him step forward, I yield him place; he shall be your\n\ngeneral; only he must prove that he has your good at heart.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"For myself, I have done; but for yourselves, if any of you conceive    11\n\neither that he himself could be the victim of a fraud, or that he\n\ncould victimise any one else in such a thing as this, let him open his\n\nlips and explain to us how. Take your time, but when you have sifted\n\nthe matter to your hearts' content, do not go away without suffering\n\nme to tell you of something which I see looming. If it should burst\n\nupon us and prove in fact anything like what it gives signs of being\n\nnow, it is time for us to take counsel for ourselves and see that we\n\ndo not prove ourselves to be the worst and basest of men in the sight\n", "of gods and men, be they friends or be they foes.\" The words moved the\n\ncuriosity of the soldiers. They marvelled what this matter might be,\n\nand bade him explain. Thereupon he began again: \"You will not have\n\nforgotten certain places in the hills--barbaric fastnesses, but\n\nfriendly to the Cerasuntines--from which people used to come down and\n\nsell us large cattle and other things which they possessed, and if I\n\nmistake not, some of you went to the nearest of these places and made\n\npurchases in the market and came back again. Clearetus the captain\n\nlearnt of this place, that it was but a little one and unguarded. Why\n\nshould it be guarded since it was friendly? so the folk thought. Thus\n\nhe stole upon it in the dead of night, and meant to sack it without\n\nsaying a word to any of us. His design was, if he took the place, not\n\nto return again to the army, but to mount a vessel which, with his\n\nmessmates on board her, was sailing past at the time, and stowing away\n\nwhat he had seized, to set sail and begone beyond the Euxine. All this\n\nhad been agreed upon and arranged with his comrades on board the\n\nvessel, as I now discover. Accordingly, he summoned to his side all\n\nwhom he could persuade, and set off at their head against the little\n\nplace. But dawn overtook him on his march. The men collected out of\n\ntheir strongholds, and whether from a distance or close quarters, made\n\nsuch a fight that they killed Clearetus and a good many of the rest,\n\nand only a few of them got safe back to Cerasus.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"These things took place on the day on which we started to come hither\n\non foot; while some of those who were to go by sea were still at\n\nCerasus, not having as yet weighed anchor. After this, according to     17\n\nwhat the Cerasuntines state, there arrived three inhabitants of the\n\nplace which had been attacked; three elderly men, seeking an interview\n\nwith our public assembly. Not finding us, they addressed themselves to\n\nthe men of Cerasus, and told them, they were astonished that we should\n", "have thought it right to attack them; however, when, as the\n\nCerasuntines assert, they had assured them that the occurrence was not\n\nauthorised by public consent, they were pleased, and proposed to sail\n\nhere, not only to state to us what had occurred, but to offer that\n\nthose who were interested should take up and bury the bodies of the\n\nslain.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"But among the Hellenes still at Cerasus were some of those who had\n\nescaped. They found out in which direction the barbarians were minded\n\nto go, and not only had the face themselves to pelt them with stones,\n\nbut vociferously encouraged their neighbours to do the same. The three\n\nmen--ambassadors, mark you--were slain, stoned to death. After this\n\noccurrence, the men of Cerasus came to us and reported the affair, and\n\nwe generals, on being informed, were annoyed at what had taken place,\n\nand took counsel with the Cerasuntines how the dead bodies of the\n\nHellenes might be buried. While seated in conclave outside the camp,\n\nwe suddenly were aware of a great hubbub. We heard cries: 'Cut them\n\ndown!' 'Shoot them!' 'Stone them!' and presently we caught sight of a\n\nmass of people racing towards us with stones in their hands, and\n\nothers picking them up. The Cerasuntines, naturally enough,\n\nconsidering the incident they had lately witnessed, retired in terror\n\nto their vessels, and, upon my word, some of us did not feel too\n\ncomfortable. All I could do was to go to them and inquire what it all\n\nmeant. Some of them had not the slightest notion, although they had\n\nstones in their hands, but chancing on some one who was better\n\ninformed, I was told by him that 'the clerks of the market were\n\ntreating the army most scandalously.' Just then some one got sight of\n\nthe market clerk, Zelarchus, making his way off towards the sea, and\n\nlifted up his voice aloud, and the rest responding to the cry as if a   24\n\nwild boar or a stag had been started, they rushed upon him.\n", "<br/><br/>\n\"The Cerasuntines, seeing a rush in their direction, thought that,\n\nwithout a doubt, it was directed against themselves, and fled with all\n\nspeed and threw themselves into the sea, in which proceeding they were\n\nimitated by some few of our own men, and all who did not know how to\n\nswim were drowned. But now, what do you think of their case, these men\n\nof Cerasus? They had done no wrong. They were simply afraid that some\n\nmadness had seized us, like that to which dogs are liable.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"I say then, if proceedings like this are to be the order of the day,\n\nyou had better consider what the ultimate condition of the army is\n\nlike to be. As a body you will not have it in your power to undertake\n\nwar against whom you like, or to conclude peace. But in private any\n\none who chooses will conduct the army on any quest which takes his\n\nfancy. And when ambassadors come to you to demand peace, or whatever\n\nit may be, officious people will put them to death and prevent your\n\nhearing the proposals which brought them to you. The next step will be\n\nthat those whom you as a body may choose as generals will be of no\n\naccount; but any one who likes to elect himself general, and will\n\nadopt the formula 'Shoot him! shoot him!' will be competent to cut\n\ndown whomsoever he pleases untried, be it general or private soldier,\n\nif only he have sufficient followers, as was the case just now. But\n\njust consider what these self-appointed generals have achieved for\n\nyou. Zelarchus, the clerk of the market, may possibly have done you a\n\nwrong; if so, he has sailed off and is gone without paying you any\n\npenalty; or he may be guiltless, in which case we have driven him from\n\nthe army in terror of perishing unjustly without a trial. While those\n\nwho stoned the ambassadors have contrived so cleverly that we alone of\n\nall Hellenes cannot approach Cerasus safely without a strong force,\n\nand the corpses which the very men who slew them themselves invited us\n", "to bury, we cannot now pick up with safety even under a flag of truce.\n\nWho indeed would care to carry a flag of truce, or go as a herald with  30\n\nthe blood of heralds upon his hands? All we could do was to implore\n\nthe Cerasuntines to bury them.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"If then you approve of such doings, have a resolution passed to that\n\neffect, so that, with a prospect of like occurrences in the future, a\n\nman may privately set up a guard and do his best to fix his tent where\n\nhe can find a strong position with a commanding site. If, however,\n\nthese seem to you to be the deeds rather of wild beasts than of human\n\nbeings, bethink you of some means by which to stay them; or else, in\n\nheaven's name, how shall we do sacrifice to the gods gladly, with\n\nimpious deeds to answer for? or how shall we, who lay the knife to\n\neach other's throats, give battle to our enemies? What friendly city\n\nwill receive us when they see rampant lawlessness in our midst? Who\n\nwill have the courage to afford us a market, when we prove our\n\nworthlessness in these weightiest concerns? and what becomes of the\n\npraise we expect to win from the mouths of men? who will vouchsafe it\n\nto us, if this is our behaviour? Should we not ourselves bestow the\n\nworst of names on the perpetrators of like deeds?\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nAfter this they rose, and, as one man, proposed that the ringleaders\n\nin these matters should be punished; and that for the future, to set\n\nan example of lawlessness should be forbidden. Every such ringleader\n\nwas to be prosecuted on the capital charge; the generals were to bring\n\nall offenders to the bar of justice; prosecutions for all other\n\nmisdemeanours committed since the death of Cyrus were to be\n\ninstituted; and they ended by constituting the officers into a board\n\nof dicasts (2); and upon the strong representation of Xenophon, with\n\nthe concurrence of the soothsayers, it was resolved to purify the\n", "army, and this purification was made.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (2) I.e. a board of judges or jurors.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nVIII\n\n<br/><br/>\nIt was further resolved that the generals themselves should undergo a   1\n\njudicial examination in reference to their conduct in past time. In\n\ncourse of investigation, Philesius and Xanthicles respectively were\n\ncondemned to pay a sum of twenty minae, to meet a deficiency to that\n\namount incurred during the guardianship of the cargoes of the\n\nmerchantmen. Sophaenetus was fined ten minae for inadequate performance\n\nof his duty as one of the chief officers selected. Against Xenophon a\n\ncharge was brought by certain people, who asserted that they had been\n\nbeaten by him, and framed the indictment as one of personal outrage\n\nwith violence (1). Xenophon got up and demanded that the first speaker\n\nshould state \"where and when it was he had received these blows.\" The\n\nother, so challenged, answered, \"When we were perishing of cold and\n\nthere was a great depth of snow.\" Xenophon said: \"Upon my word, with\n\nweather such as you describe, when our provisions had run out, when\n\nthe wine could not even be smelt, when numbers were dropping down dead\n\nbeat, so acute was the suffering, with the enemy close on our heels;\n\ncertainly, if at such a season as that I was guilty of outrage, I\n\nplead guilty to being a more outrageous brute than the ass, which is\n\ntoo wanton, they say, to feel fatigue. Still, I wish you would tell\n\nus,\" said he, \"what led to my striking you. Did I ask you for\n\nsomething and, on your refusing it to me, did I proceed to beat you?\n", "Was it a debt, for which I demanded payment? or a quarrel about some\n\nboy or other? Was I the worse for liquor, and behaving like a\n\ndrunkard?\" When the man met each of these questions with a negative,\n\nhe questioned him further: \"Are you a heavy infantry soldier?\" \"No,\"\n\nsaid he. \"A peltast, then?\" \"No, nor yet a peltast\"; but he had been\n\nordered by his messmates to drive a mule, although he was a free man.   5\n\nThen at last he recognised him, and inquired: \"Are you the fellow who\n\ncarried home the sick man?\" \"Yes, I am,\" said he, \"thanks to your\n\ndriving; and you made havoc of my messmates' kit.\" \"Havoc!\" said\n\nXenophon: \"Nay, I distributed it; some to one man, some to another to\n\ncarry, and bade them bring the things safely to me; and when I got\n\nthem back I delivered them all safely to you, and you, on your side,\n\nhad rendered an account to me of the man. Let me tell you,\" he\n\ncontinued, turning to the court, \"what the circumstances were; it is\n\nworth hearing:--\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) See the \"Dict. of Antiq.\" 622 a. HYBREOS GRAPHE. In the case of\n\n    common assaults as opposed to indecent assault, the prosecution\n\n    seems to have been allowable only when the object of a wanton\n\n    attack was a free person. Cf. Arist. \"Rhet.\" ii. 24.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"A man was left behind from inability to proceed farther; I recognised\n\nthe poor fellow sufficiently to see that he was one of ours, and I\n\nforced you, sir, to carry him to save his life. For if I am not much\n\nmistaken, the enemy were close at our heels?\" The fellow assented to\n\nthis. \"Well then,\" said Xenophon, \"after I had sent you forward, I\n\novertook you again, as I came up with the rearguard; you were digging\n\na trench with intent to bury the man; I pulled up and said something\n\nin commendation; as we stood by the poor fellow twitched his leg, and\n\nthe bystanders all cried out, 'Why, the man's alive!' Your remark was:\n", "'Alive or not as he likes, I am not going to carry him' Then I struck\n\nyou. Yes! you are right, for it looked very much as if you knew him to\n\nbe alive.\" \"Well,\" said he, \"was he any the less dead when I reported\n\nhim to you?\" \"Nay,\" retorted Xenophon, \"by the same token we shall all\n\none day be dead, but that is no reason why meantime we should all be\n\nburied alive?\" Then there was a general shout: \"If Xenophon had given\n\nthe fellow a few more blows, it might have been better.\" The others\n\nwere now called upon to state the grounds on which they had been\n\nbeaten in each case; but when they refused to get up, he proceeded to\n\nstate them himself.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"I confess, sirs, to having struck certain men for failure in\n\ndiscipline. These were men who were quite content to owe their safety\n\nto us. Whilst the rest of the world marched on in rank and did\n\nwhatever fighting had to be done, they preferred to leave the ranks,\n\nand rush forward to loot and enrich themselves at our expense. Now, if  13\n\nthis conduct were to be the rule, general ruin would be the result. I\n\ndo not deny that I have given blows to this man or the other who\n\nplayed the poltroon and refused to get up, helplessly abandoning\n\nhimself to the enemy; and so I forced them to march on. For once in\n\nthe severe wintry weather I myself happened to sit down for a long\n\ntime, whilst waiting for a party who were getting their kit together,\n\nand I discovered how difficult it was to get up again and stretch\n\none's legs. After this personal experience, whenever I saw any one\n\nelse seated in slack and lazy mood, I tried to spur him on. The mere\n\nmovement and effort to play the man caused warmth and moisture,\n\nwhereas it was plain that sitting down and keeping quiet helped the\n\nblood to freeze and the toes to mortify, calamities which really\n\nbefell several of the men, as you yourselves are aware.\n\n<br/><br/>", "\"I can imagine a third case, that of some straggler stopping behind,\n\nmerely to rest for rest's sake, and hindering you in front and us\n\nbehind alike from pressing on the march. If he got a blow with the\n\nfist from me it saved him a thrust with the lance from the enemy. In\n\nfact, the opportunity they enjoy to-day of taking vengeance on me for\n\nany treatment which I put upon them wrongfully, is derived from their\n\nsalvation then; whereas, if they had fallen into the enemy's hands,\n\nlet them ask themselves for what outrage, however great, they could\n\nexpect to get satisfaction now. My defence,\" he continued, \"is simple:\n\nif I chastised any one for his own good, I claim to suffer the same\n\npenalties as parents pay their children or masters their boys. Does\n\nnot the surgeon also cauterise and cut us for our good? But if you\n\nreally believe that these acts are the outcome of wanton insolence, I\n\nbeg you to observe that although to-day, thank God! I am heartier than\n\nformerly, I wear a bolder front now than then, and I drink more wine,\n\nyet I never strike a soul; no, for I see that you have reached smooth\n\nwater. When storm arises, and a great sea strikes the vessel\n\namidships, a mere shake of the head will make the look-out man furious\n\nwith the crew in the forecastle, or the helmsman with the men in the\n\nstern sheets, for at such a crisis even a slight slip may ruin\n\neverything. But I appeal to your own verdict, already recorded, in      21\n\nproof that I was justified in striking these men. You stood by, sirs,\n\nwith swords, not voting tablets, in your hands, and it was in your\n\npower to aid the fellows if you liked; but, to speak the honest truth,\n\nyou neither aided them nor did you join me in striking the disorderly.\n\nIn other words, you enabled any evilly-disposed person among them to\n\ngive rein to his wantonness by your passivity. For if you will be at\n\npains to investigate, you will find that those who were then most\n\ncowardly are the ringleaders to-day in brutality and outrage.\n\n<br/><br/>", "\"There is Boiscus the boxer, a Thessalian, what a battle he fought\n\nthen to escape carrying his shield! so tired was he, and to-day I am\n\ntold he has stripped several citizens of Cotyora of the clothes on\n\ntheir backs. If then you are wise, you will treat this personage in a\n\nway the contrary to that in which men treat dogs. A savage dog is tied\n\nup on the day and loosed at night, but if you are wise you will tie\n\nthis fellow up at night and only let him loose in the day.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"But really,\" he added, \"it does surprise me with what keenness you\n\nremember and recount the times when I incurred the hatred of some one;\n\nbut some other occasions when I eased the burden of winter and storm\n\nfor any of you, or beat off an enemy, or helped to minister to you in\n\nsickness and want, not a soul of you remembers these. Or when for any\n\nnoble deed done by any of you I praised the doer, and according to my\n\nability did honour to this brave man or that; these things have\n\nslipped from your memories, and are clean forgotten. Yet it were\n\nsurely more noble, just, and holy, sweeter and kindlier to treasure\n\nthe memory of good rather than of evil.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nHe ended, and then one after another of the assembly got up and began\n\nrecalling incidents of the kind suggested, and things ended not so\n\nunpleasantly after all.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nBOOK VI\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>", "<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nI\n\n<br/><br/>\nAfter this, whilst waiting, they lived partly on supplies from the      1\n\nmarket, partly on the fruit of raids into Paphlagonia. The\n\nPaphlagonians, on their side, showed much skill in kidnapping\n\nstragglers, wherever they could lay hands on them, and in the night\n\ntime tried to do mischief to those whose quarters were at a distance\n\nfrom the camp. The result was that their relations to one another were\n\nexceedingly hostile, so much so that Corylas, who was the chief of\n\nPaphlagonia at that date, sent ambassadors to the Hellenes, bearing\n\nhorses and fine apparel, and charged with a proposal on the part of\n\nCorylas to make terms with the Hellenes on the principle of mutual\n\nforbearance from injuries. The generals replied that they would\n\nconsult with the army about the matter. Meanwhile they gave them a\n\nhospitable reception, to which they invited certain members of the\n\narmy whose claims were obvious. They sacrificed some of the captive\n\ncattle and other sacrificial beasts, and with these they furnished\n\nforth a sufficiently festal entertainment, and reclining on their\n\ntruckle beds, fell to eating and drinking out of beakers made of horn\n\nwhich they happened to find in the country.\n\n<br/><br/>\nBut as soon as the libation was ended and they had sung the hymn, up\n\ngot first some Thracians, who performed a dance under arms to the\n\nsound of a pipe, leaping high into the air with much nimbleness, and\n\nbrandishing their swords, till at last one man struck his fellow, and\n\nevery one thought he was really wounded, so skilfully and artistically  6\n\ndid he fall, and the Paphlagonians screamed out. Then he that gave the\n\nblow stripped the other of his arms, and marched off chanting the\n", "\"Sitalcas (1),\" whilst others of the Thracians bore off the other, who\n\nlay as if dead, though he had not received even a scratch.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) I.e. the national Thracian hymn; for Sitalcas the king, a national\n\n    hero, see Thuc. ii. 29.\n\n<br/><br/>\nAfter this some Aenianians (2) and Magnesians got up and fell to\n\ndancing the Carpaea, as it is called, under arms. This was the manner\n\nof the dance: one man lays aside his arms and proceeds to drive a yoke\n\nof oxen, and while he drives he sows, turning him about frequently, as\n\nthough he were afraid of something; up comes a cattle-lifter, and no\n\nsooner does the ploughman catch sight of him afar, than he snatches up\n\nhis arms and confronts him. They fight in front of his team, and all\n\nin rhythm to the sound of the pipe. At last the robber binds the\n\ncountryman and drives off the team. Or sometimes the cattle-driver\n\nbinds the robber, and then he puts him under the yoke beside the oxen,\n\nwith his two hands tied behind his back, and off he drives.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (2) The Aenianians, an Aeolian people inhabiting the upper valley of\n\n    the Sperchius (the ancient Phthia); their capital was Hypata.\n\n    These men belonged to the army collected by Menon, the Thessalian.\n\n    So, doubtless, did the Magnesians, another Aeolian tribe occupying\n\n    the mountainous coast district on the east of Thessaly. See\n\n    Kiepert's \"Man. Anct. Geog.\" (Macmillan's tr.), chap. vi.. 161,\n\n    170.\n\n<br/><br/>\nAfter this a Mysian came in with a light shield in either hand and\n\ndanced, at one time going through a pantomime, as if he were dealing\n\nwith two assailants at once; at another plying his shields as if to\n\nface a single foe, and then again he would whirl about and throw\n", "somersaults, keeping the shields in his hands, so that it was a\n\nbeautiful spectacle. Last of all he danced the Persian dance, clashing\n\nthe shields together, crouching down on one knee and springing up\n\nagain from earth; and all this he did in measured time to the sound of\n\nthe flute. After him the Mantineans stepped upon the stage, and some\n\nother Arcadians also stood up; they had accoutred themselves in all\n\ntheir warlike finery. They marched with measured tread, pipes playing,\n\nto the tune of the 'warrior's march (3)'; the notes of the paean rose,   11\n\nlightly their limbs moved in dance, as in solemn procession to the\n\nholy gods. The Paphlagonians looked upon it as something truly strange\n\nthat all these dances should be under arms; and the Mysians, seeing\n\ntheir astonishment persuaded one of the Arcadians who had got a\n\ndancing girl to let him introduce her, which he did after dressing her\n\nup magnificently and giving her a light shield. When, lithe of limb,\n\nshe danced the Pyrrhic (4), loud clapping followed; and the\n\nPaphlagonians asked, \"If these women fought by their side in battle?\"\n\nto which they answered, \"To be sure, it was the women who routed the\n\ngreat King, and drove him out of camp.\" So ended the night.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (3) See Plato, \"Rep.\" 400 B, for this \"war measure\"; also Aristoph.\n\n    \"Clouds,\" 653.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (4) For this famous dance, supposed to be of Doric (Cretan or Spartan)\n\n    origin, see Smith's \"Dict. of Antiquities,\" \"Saltatio\"; also Guhl\n\n    and Koner, \"The Life of the Greeks and Romans,\" Eng. tr.\n\n<br/><br/>\nBut next day the generals introduced the embassy to the army, and the\n\nsoldiers passed a resolution in the sense proposed: between themselves\n\nand the Paphlagonians there was to be a mutual abstinence from\n\ninjuries. After this the ambassadors went on their way, and the\n", "Hellenes, as soon as it was thought that sufficient vessels had\n\narrived, went on board ship, and voyaged a day and a night with a fair\n\nbreeze, keeping Paphlagonia on their left. And on the following day,\n\narriving at Sinope, they came to moorings in the harbour of Harmene,\n\nnear Sinope (5). The Sinopeans, though inhabitants of Paphlagonia, are\n\nreally colonists of the Milesians. They sent gifts of hospitality to\n\nthe Hellenes, three thousand measures of barley with fifteen hundred\n\njars of wine. At this place Cheirisophus rejoined them with a\n\nman-of-war. The soldiers certainly expected that, having come, he\n\nwould have brought them something, but he brought them nothing, except\n\ncomplimentary phrases, on the part of Anaxibius, the high admiral, and\n\nthe rest, who sent them their congratulations, coupled with a promise\n\non the part of Anaxibius that, as soon as they were outside the\n\nEuxine, pay would be forthcoming.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (5) Harmene, a port of Sinope, between four and five miles (fifty\n\n    stades) west of that important city, itself a port town. See\n\n    Smith, \"Dict. Geog.,\" \"Sinope\"; and Kiepert, op. cit. chap. iv.\n\n    60.\n\n<br/><br/>\nAt Harmene the army halted five days; and now that they seemed to be    17\n\nso close to Hellas, the question how they were to reach home not\n\nempty-handed presented itself more forcibly to their minds than\n\nheretofore. The conclusion they came to was to appoint a single\n\ngeneral, since one man would be better able to handle the troops, by\n\nnight or by day, than was possible while the generalship was divided.\n\nIf secrecy were desirable, it would be easier to keep matters dark, or\n\nif again expedition were an object, there would be less risk of\n\narriving a day too late, since mutual explanations would be avoided,\n\nand whatever approved itself to the single judgement would at once be\n", "carried into effect, whereas previously the generals had done\n\neverything in obedience to the opinion of the majority.\n\n<br/><br/>\nWith these ideas working in their minds, they turned to Xenophon, and\n\nthe officers came to him and told him that this was how the soldiers\n\nviewed matters; and each of them, displaying a warmth of kindly\n\nfeeling, pressed him to accept the office. Xenophon partly would have\n\nliked to do so, in the belief that by so doing he would win to himself\n\na higher repute in the esteem of his friends, and that his name would\n\nbe reported to the city written large; and by some stroke of fortune\n\nhe might even be the discoverer of some blessing to the army\n\ncollectively.\n\n<br/><br/>\nThese and the like considerations elated him; he had a strong desire\n\nto hold the supreme command. But then again, as he turned the matter\n\nover, the conviction deepened in his mind that the issue of the future\n\nis to every man uncertain; and hence there was the risk of perhaps\n\nlosing such reputation has he had already acquired. He was in sore\n\nstraights, and, not knowing how to decide, it seemed best to him to\n\nlay the matter before heaven. Accordingly, he led two victims to the\n\naltar and made sacrifice to Zeus the King, for it was he and no other\n\nwho had been named by the oracle at Delphi, and his belief was that\n\nthe vision which he had beheld when he first essayed to undertake the\n\njoint administration of the army was sent to him by that god. He also\n\nrecalled to mind a circumstance which befell him still earlier, when    23\n\nsetting out from Ephesus to associate himself with Cyrus (6);--how an\n\neagle screamed on his right hand from the east, and still remained\n\nperched, and the soothsayer who was escorting him said that it was a\n\ngreat and royal omen (7); indicating glory and yet suffering; for the\n\npunier race of birds only attack the eagle when seated. \"Yet,\" added\n", "he, \"it bodes not gain in money; for the eagle seizes his food, not\n\nwhen seated, but on the wing.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\n (6) Cf. \"Cyrop.\" II. i. 1; an eagle appears to Cyrus on the frontiers\n\n    of Persia, when about to join his uncle Cyaxares, king of Media,\n\n    on his expedition against the Assyrian.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (7) It is important to note that the Greek word {oionos}, a solitary\n\n    or lone-flying bird, also means an omen. \"It was a mighty bird and\n\n    a mighty omen.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nThus Xenophon sacrificed, and the god as plainly as might be gave him\n\na sign, neither to demand the generalship, nor, if chosen, to accept\n\nthe office. And that was how the matter stood when the army met, and\n\nthe proposal to elect a single leader was unanimous. After this\n\nresolution was passed, they proposed Xenophon for election, and when\n\nit seemed quite evident that they would elect him, if he put the\n\nquestion to the vote, he got up and spoke as follows:--\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"Sirs, I am but mortal, and must needs be happy to be honoured by you.\n\nI thank you, and am grateful, and my prayer is that the gods may grant\n\nme to be an instrument of blessing to you. Still, when I consider it\n\ncloser, thus, in the presence of a Lacedaemonian, to be preferred by\n\nyou as general, seems to me but ill conducive either to your interests\n\nor to mine, since you will the less readily obtain from them hereafter\n\nanything you may need, while for myself I look upon acceptance as even\n\nsomewhat dangerous. Do I not see and know with what persistence these\n\nLacedaemonians prosecuted the war till finally they forced our State\n\nto acknowledge the leadership of Lacedaemon? This confession once\n\nextorted from their antagonists, they ceased warring at once, and the\n", "siege of the city was at an end. If, with these facts before my eyes,\n\nI seem to be doing all I can to neutralise their high self-esteem, I\n\ncannot escape the reflection that personally I may be taught wisdom by\n\na painful process. But with your own idea that under a single general\n\nthere will be less factiousness than when there were many, be assured   29\n\nthat in choosing some other than me you will not find me factious. I\n\nhold that whosoever sets up factious opposition to his leader\n\nfactiously opposes his own safety. While if you determine to choose\n\nme, I should not be surprised were that choice to entail upon you and\n\nme the resentment of other people.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nAfter those remarks on Xenophon's part, many more got up, one after\n\nanother, insisting on the propriety of his undertaking the command.\n\nOne of them, Agasias the Stymphalian, said: It was really ridiculous,\n\nif things had come to this pass that the Lacedeamonians are to fly\n\ninto a rage because a number of friends have met together to dinner,\n\nand omitted to choose a Lacedaemonian to sit at the head of the table.\n\n\"Really, if that is how matters stand,\" said he, \"I do not see what\n\nright we have to be officers even, we who are only Arcadians.\" That\n\nsally brought down the plaudits of the assembly; and Xenophon, seeing\n\nthat something more was needed, stepped forward again and spoke,\n\n\"Pardon, sirs,\" he said, \"let me make a clean breast of it. I swear to\n\nyou by all the gods and goddesses; verily and indeed, I no sooner\n\nperceived your purpose, than I consulted the victims, whether it was\n\nbetter for you to entrust this leadership to me, and for me to\n\nundertake it, or the reverse. And the gods vouchsafed a sign to me so\n\nplain that even a common man might understand it, and perceive that\n\nfrom such sovereignty I must needs hold myself aloof.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nUnder these circumstances they chose Cheirisophus, who, after his\n", "election, stepped forward and said: \"Nay, sirs, be well assured of\n\nthis, that had you chosen some one else, I for my part should not have\n\nset up factious opposition. As to Xenophon, I believe you have done\n\nhim a good turn by not appointing him; for even now Dexippus has gone\n\nsome way in traducing him to Anaxibius, as far as it lay in his power\n\nto do so, and that, in spite of my attempts to silence him. What he\n\nsaid was that he believed Xenophon would rather share the command of\n\nClearchus's army with Timasion, a Dardanian, than with himself, a\n\nLaconian. But,\" continued Cheirisophus, \"since your choice has fallen   33\n\nupon me, I will make it my endeavour to do you all the good in my\n\npower; so make your preparations to weigh anchor to-morrow; wind and\n\nweather permitting, we will voyage to Heraclea; every one must\n\nendeavour, therefore, to put in at that port; and for the rest we will\n\nconsult, when we are come thither.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nII\n\n<br/><br/>\nThe next day they weighed anchor and set sail from Harmene with a fair  1\n\nbreeze, two days' voyage along the coast.  (As they coasted along they\n\ncame in sight of Jason's beach (1), where, as the story says, the ship\n\nArgo came to moorings; and then the mouths of the rivers, first the\n\nThermodon, then the Iris, then the Halys, and next to it the\n\nParthenius.) Coasting past  (the latter), they reached Heraclea (2), a\n\nHellenic city and a colony of the Megarians, situated in the territory\n\nof the Mariandynians. So they came to anchorage off the Acherusian\n\nChersonese, where Heracles (3) is said to have descended to bring up\n\nthe dog Cerberus, at a point where they still show the marks of his\n", "descent, a deep cleft more than two furlongs down. Here the Heracleots\n\nsent the Hellenes, as gifts of hospitality, three thousand measures of\n\nbarley and two thousand jars of wine, twenty beeves and one hundred\n\nsheep. Through the flat country here flows the Lycus river, as it is\n\ncalled, about two hundred feet in breadth.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) I have left this passage in the text, although it involves, at\n\n    first sight, a topographical error on the part of whoever wrote\n\n    it, and Hug and other commentators regard it as spurious. Jason's\n\n    beach (the modern Yasoun Bouroun) and the three first-named rivers\n\n    lie between Cotyora and Sinope. Possibly the author, or one of his\n\n    editors, somewhat loosely inserted a recapitulatory note\n\n    concerning the scenery of this coasting voyage at this point. \"By\n\n    the way, I ought to have told you that as they coasted along,\"\n\n    etc.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (2) One of the most powerful of commercial cities, distinguished as\n\n    Pontica (whence, in the middle ages, Penteraklia), now Eregli. It\n\n    was one of the older Greek settlements, and, like Kalchedon (to\n\n    give that town its proper name), a Megaro-Doric colony. See\n\n    Kiepert, op. cit. chap. iv. 62.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (3) According to another version of the legend Heracles went down to\n\n    bring up Cerberus, not here, but at Taenarum.\n\n<br/><br/>\nThe soldiers held a meeting, and took counsel about the remainder of\n\nthe journey: should they make their exit from the Pontus by sea or by\n\nland? and Lycon the Achaean got up and said: \"I am astonished, sirs,\n\nthat the generals do not endeavour to provide us more efficiently with\n\nprovisions. These gifts of hospitality will not afford three days'      4\n", "victuals for the army; nor do I see from what region we are to provide\n\nourselves as we march. My proposal, therefore, is to demand of the\n\nHeracleots at least three thousand cyzicenes.\" Another speaker\n\nsuggested, \"not less than ten thousand. Let us at once, before we\n\nbreak up this meeting, send ambassadors to the city and ascertain\n\ntheir answer to the demand and take counsel accordingly.\" Thereupon\n\nthey proceeded to put up as ambassadors, first and foremost\n\nCheirisophus, as he had been chosen general-in-chief; others also\n\nnamed Xenophon.\n\n<br/><br/>\nBut both Cheirisophus and Xenophon stoutly declined, maintaining both\n\nalike that they could not compel a Hellenic city, actually friendly,\n\nto give anything which they did not spontaneously offer. So, since\n\nthese two appeared to be backward, the soldiers sent Lycon the\n\nAchaean, Callimachus the Parrhasian, and Agasias the Stymphalian.\n\nThese three went and announced the resolutions passed by the army.\n\nLycon, it was said, even went so far as to threaten certain\n\nconsequences in case they refused to comply. The Heracleots said they\n\nwould deliberate; and, without more ado, they got together their goods\n\nand chattels from their farms and fields outside, and dismantled the\n\nmarket outside and transferred it within, after which the gates were\n\nclosed, and arms appeared at the battlements of the walls.\n\n<br/><br/>\nAt that check, the authors of these tumultuary measures fell to\n\naccusing the generals, as if they had marred the proceeding; and the\n\nArcadians and Archaeans banded together, chiefly under the auspices of\n\nthe two ringleaders, Callimachus the Parrhasian and Lycon the Achaean.\n\nThe language they held was to this effect: It was outrageous that a\n\nsingle Athenian and a Lacedaemonian, who had not contributed a soldier\n\nto the expedition, should rule Peloponnesians; scandalous that they\n", "themselves should bear the toils whilst others pocketed the spoils,\n\nand that too though the preservation of the army was due to\n\nthemselves; for, as every one must admit, to the Arcadians and          10\n\nAchaeans the credit of that achievement was due, and the rest of the\n\narmy went for nothing (which was indeed so far true that the Arcadians\n\nand Achaeans did form numerically the larger half of the whole army).\n\nWhat then did common sense suggest? Why, that they, the Arcadians and\n\nAchaeans, should make common cause, choose generals for themselves\n\nindependently, continue the march, and try somewhat to better their\n\ncondition. This proposal was carried. All the Arcadians and Achaeans\n\nwho chanced to be with Cheirisophus left him and Xenophon, setting up\n\nfor themselves and choosing ten generals of their own. These ten, it\n\nwas decreed, were to put into effect such measures as approved\n\nthemselves to the majority. Thus the absolute authority vested in\n\nCheirisophus was terminated there and then, within less than a week of\n\nhis appointment.\n\n<br/><br/>\nXenophon, however was minded to prosecute the journey in their\n\ncompany, thinking that this would be a safer plan than for each to\n\nstart on his own account. But Neon threw in his weight in favour of\n\nseparate action. \"Every one for himself,\" he said, for he had heard\n\nfrom Cheirisophus that Cleander, the Spartan governor-general at\n\nByzantium, talked of coming to Calpe Haven with some war vessels.\n\nNeon's advice was due to his desire to secure a passage home in these\n\nwar vessels for themselves and their soldiers, without allowing any\n\none else to share in their good-fortune. As for Cheirisophus, he was\n\nat once so out of heart at the turn things had taken, and soured with\n\nthe whole army, that he left it to his subordinate, Neon, to do just\n\nwhat he liked. Xenophon, on his side, would still have been glad to be\n\nquit of the expedition and sail home; but on offering sacrifice to\n", "Heracles the Leader, and seeking advice, whether it were better and\n\nmore desirable to continue the march in charge of the soldiers who had\n\nremained faithful, or to take his departure, the god indicated to him\n\nby the victims that he should adopt the former course.\n\n<br/><br/>\nIn this way the army was now split up into three divisions (4). First,\n\nthe Arcadians and Achaeans, over four thousand five hundred men, all\n\nheavy infantry. Secondly, Cheirisophus and his men, viz. one thousand   16\n\nfour hundred heavy infantry and the seven hundred peltasts, or\n\nClearchus's Thracians. Thirdly, Xenophon's division of one thousand\n\nseven hundred heavy infantry, and three hundred peltasts; but then he\n\nalone had the cavalry--about forty troopers.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (4) The total now amounted to 8640 and over.\n\n<br/><br/>\nThe Arcadians, who had bargained with the Heracleots and got some\n\nvessels from them, were the first to set sail; they hoped, by pouncing\n\nsuddenly on the Bithynians, to make as large a haul as possible. With\n\nthat object they disembarked at Calpe Haven (5), pretty nearly at the\n\nmiddle point in Thrace. Cheirisophus setting off straight from\n\nHeraclea, commenced a land march through the country; but having\n\nentered into Thrace, he preferred to cling to the seaboard, health and\n\nstrength failing him. Xenophon, lastly, took vessels, and disembarking\n\non the confines of Thrace and the Heracleotid, pushed forward through\n\nthe heart of the country (6).\n\n<br/><br/>\n (5) The Haven of Calpe = Kirpe Liman or Karpe in the modern maps. The\n\n    name is interesting as being also the ancient name of the rock\n\n    fortress of Gibraltar.\n\n<br/><br/>", " (6) Some MSS. here read, \"In the prior chapter will be found a\n\n    description of the manner in which the absolute command of\n\n    Cheirisophus was abruptly terminated and the army of the Hellenes\n\n    broken up. The sequel will show how each of these divisions\n\n    fared.\" The passage is probably one of those commentators' notes,\n\n    with which we are now familiar.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nIII\n\n<br/><br/>\nThe Arcadians, disembarking under cover of night at Calpe Haven,        1\n\nmarched against the nearest villages about thirty furlongs from the\n\nsea; and as soon as it was light, each of the ten generals led his\n\ncompany to attack one village, or if the village were large, a couple\n\nof companies advanced under their combined generals. They further\n\nagreed upon a certain knoll, where they were all eventually to\n\nassemble. So sudden was their attack that they seized a number of\n\ncaptives and enclosed a multitude of small cattle. But the Thracians\n\nwho escaped began to collect again; for being light-armed troops they\n\nhad slipped in large numbers through the hands of the heavy infantry;\n\nand now that they were got together they first attacked the company of\n\nthe Arcadian general, Smicres, who had done his work and was retiring\n\nto the appointed meeting-place, driving along a large train of\n\ncaptives and cattle. For a good while the Hellenes maintained a\n\nrunning fight (1); but at the passage of a gorge the enemy routed them,  5\n\nslaying Smicres himself and those with him to a man. The fate of\n\nanother company under command of Hegesander, another of the ten, was\n\nnearly as bad; only eight men escaped, Hegesander being one of them.\n", "The remaining captains eventually met, some with somewhat to show for\n\ntheir pains, others empty-handed.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) Lit. \"marched and fought,\" as did the forlorn hope under Sir C.\n\n    Wilson making its way from Abu Klea to the Nile in Jan. 1885.\n\n<br/><br/>\nThe Thracians, having achieved this success, kept up a continual\n\nshouting and clatter of conversation to one another during the night;\n\nbut with day-dawn they marshalled themselves right round the knoll on\n\nwhich the Hellenes were encamped--both cavalry in large numbers and\n\nlight-armed troops--while every minute the stream of new-comers grew\n\ngreater. Then they commenced an attack on the heavy infantry in all\n\nsecurity, for the Hellenes had not a single bowman, javelin-man, or\n\nmounted trooper amongst them; while the enemy rushed forward on foot\n\nor galloped up on horseback and let fly their javelins. It was vain to\n\nattempt to retaliate, so lightly did they spring back and escape; and\n\never the attack renewed itself from every point, so that on one side\n\nman after man was wounded, on the other not a soul was touched; the\n\nresult being that they could not stir from their position, and the\n\nThracians ended by cutting them off even from their water. In their\n\ndespair they began to parley about a truce, and finally various\n\nconcessions were made and terms agreed to between them; but the\n\nThracians would not hear of giving hostages in answer to the demand of\n\nthe Hellenes; at that point the matter rested. So fared it with the\n\nArcadians.\n\n<br/><br/>\nAs to Cheirisophus, that general prosecuted his march along the         10\n\nseaboard, and without check reached Calpe Haven. Xenophon advanced\n\nthrough the heart of the country; and his cavalry pushing on in front,\n\ncame upon some old men pursuing their road somewither, who were\n", "brought to him, and in answer to his question, whether they had caught\n\nsight of another Hellenic army anywhere, told him all that had already\n\ntaken place, adding that at present they were being besieged upon a\n\nknoll with all the Thracians in close circle round them. Thereupon he\n\nkept the old men under strict guard to serve as guides in case of\n\nneed; next, having appointed outposts, he called a meeting of the\n\nsoldiers, and addressed them: \"Soldiers, some of the Arcadians are\n\ndead and the rest are being besieged upon a certain knoll. Now my own\n\nbelief is, that if they are to perish, with their deaths the seal is\n\nset to our own fate: since we must reckon with an enemy at once\n\nnumerous and emboldened. Clearly our best course is to hasten to their\n\nrescue, if haply we may find them still alive, and do battle by their\n\nside rather than suffer isolation, confronting danger single-handed.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"Let us then at once push forward as far as may seem opportune till\n\nsupper-time, and then encamp. As long as we are marching, let\n\nTimasion, with the cavalry, gallop on in front, but without losing\n\nsight of us; and let him examine all closely in front, so that nothing\n\nmay escape our observation.\" (At the same time too, he sent out some\n\nnimble fellows of the light-armed troops to the flanks and to the high\n\ntops, who were to give a signal if they espied anything anywhere;\n\nordering them to burn everything inflammable which lay in their path.)\n\n\"As for ourselves,\" he continued, \"we need not look to find cover in\n\nany direction; for it is a long step back to Heraclea and a long leap\n\nacross to Chrysopolis, and the enemy is at the door. The shortest road\n\nis to Calpe Haven, where we suppose Cheirisophus, if safe, to be; but\n\nthen, when we get there, at Calpe Haven there are no vessels for us to\n\nsail away in; and if we stop here, we have not provisions for a single\n\nday. Suppose the beleaguered Arcadians left to their fate, we shall\n\nfind it but a sorry alternative to run the gauntlet with\n", "Cheirisophus's detachment alone; better to save them if we can, and     17\n\nwith united forces work out our deliverance in common. But if so, we\n\nmust set out with minds prepared, since to-day either a glorious death\n\nawaits us or the achievement of a deed of noblest emprise in the\n\nrescue of so many Hellene lives. Maybe it is God who leads us thus,\n\nGod who chooses to humble the proud boaster, boasting as though he\n\nwere exceedingly wise, but for us, the beginning of whose every act is\n\nby heaven's grace, that same God reserves a higher grade of honour.\n\nOne duty I would recall to you, to apply your minds to the execution\n\nof the orders with promptitude.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nWith these words he led the way. The cavalry, scattering as far in\n\nadvance as was prudent, wherever they set foot, set fire. The peltasts\n\nmoving parallel on the high ground were similarly employed, burning\n\neverything combustible they could discover. While the main army,\n\nwherever they came upon anything which had accidentally escaped,\n\ncompleted the work, so that the whole country looked as if it were\n\nablaze; and the army might easily pass for a larger one. When the hour\n\nhad come, they turned aside to a knoll and took up quarters; and there\n\nthey espied the enemy's watch-fires. He was about forty furlongs\n\ndistant. On their side also they kindled as many watch-fires as\n\npossible; but as soon as they had dined the order was passed to quench\n\nall the fires. So during the night they posted guards and slept. But\n\nat daybreak they offered prayers to the gods, and drawing up in order\n\nof battle, began marching with what speed they might. Timasion and the\n\ncavalry, who had the guides with them, and were moving on briskly in\n\nfront, found themselves without knowing it at the very knoll upon\n\nwhich the Hellenes had been beleaguered. But no army could they\n\ndiscover, whether of friend or foe; only some starveling old women and\n\nmen, with a few sheep and oxen which had been left behind. This news\n", "they reported to Xenophon and the main body. At first the marvel was\n\nwhat had happened; but ere long they found out by inquiries from the\n\nfolk who had been left behind, that the Thracians had set off\n\nimmediately after sundown, and were gone; the Hellenes had waited till\n\nmorning before they made off, but in what direction, they could not     23\n\nsay.\n\n<br/><br/>\nOn hearing this, Xenophon's troops first breakfasted, and then getting\n\ntheir kit together began their march, desiring to unite with the rest\n\nat Calpe's Haven without loss of time. As they continued their march,\n\nthey came across the track of the Arcadians and Achaeans along the\n\nroad to Calpe, and both divisions arriving eventually at the same\n\nplace, were overjoyed to see one another again, and they embraced each\n\nother like brothers. Then the Arcadians inquired of Xenophon's\n\nofficers--why they had quenched the watch-fires? \"At first,\" said\n\nthey, \"when we lost sight of your watch-fires, we expected you to\n\nattack the enemy in the night; and the enemy, so at least we imagined,\n\nmust have been afraid of that and so set off. The time at any rate at\n\nwhich they set off would correspond. But when the requisite time had\n\nelapsed and you did not come, we concluded that you must have learnt\n\nwhat was happening to us, and in terror had made a bolt for it to the\n\nseaboard. We resolved not to be left behind by you; and that is how we\n\nalso came to march hither.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nIV\n\n<br/><br/>\nDuring this day they contented themselves with bivouacking there on     1\n", "the beach at the harbour. The place which goes by the name of Calpe\n\nHaven is in Asiatic Thrace, the name given to a region extending from\n\nthe mouth of the Euxine all the way to Heraclea, which lies on the\n\nright hand as you sail into the Euxine. It is a long day's voyage for\n\na war-ship, using her three banks of oars, from Byzantium to Heraclea,\n\nand between these two there is not a single Hellenic or friendly city,\n\nbut only these Bithynian Thracians, who have a bad reputation for the\n\nsavagery with which they treat any Hellenes cast ashore by shipwreck\n\nor otherwise thrown into their power.\n\n<br/><br/>\nNow the haven of Calpe lies exactly midway, halving the voyage between\n\nByzantium and Heraclea. It is a long promontory running out into the\n\nsea; the seaward portion being a rocky precipice, at no point less\n\nthan twenty fathoms high; but on the landward side there is a neck      3\n\nabout four hundred feet wide; and the space inside the neck is capable\n\nof accommodating ten thousand inhabitants, and there is a haven\n\nimmediately under the crag with a beach facing the west. Then there is\n\na copious spring of fresh water flowing on the very marge of the sea\n\ncommanded by the stronghold. Again, there is plenty of wood of various\n\nsorts; but most plentiful of all, fine shipbuilding timber down to the\n\nvery edge of the sea. The upland stretches into the heart of the\n\ncountry for twenty furlongs at least. It is good loamy soil, free from\n\nstones. For a still greater distance the seaboard is thickly grown\n\nwith large timber trees of every description. The surrounding country\n\nis beautiful and spacious, containing numerous well populated\n\nvillages. The soil produces barley and wheat, and pulse of all sorts,\n\nmillet and sesame, figs in ample supply, with numerous vines producing\n\nsweet wines, and indeed everything else except olives. Such is the\n\ncharacter of the country.\n\n<br/><br/>", "The tents were pitched on the seaward-facing beach, the soldiers being\n\naltogether averse to camping on ground which might so easily be\n\nconverted into a city. Indeed, their arrival at the place at all\n\nseemed very like the crafty design of some persons who were minded to\n\nform a city. The aversion was not unnatural, since the majority of the\n\nsoldiers had not left their homes on so long a voyage from scantiness\n\nor subsistence, but attracted by the fame of Cyrus's virtues; some of\n\nthem bringing followers, while others had expended money on the\n\nexpedition. And amongst them was a third set who had run away from\n\nfathers and mothers; while a different class had left children behind,\n\nhoping to return to them with money or other gains. Other people with\n\nCyrus won great success, they were told (1); why should it not be so\n\nwith them? Being persons then of this description, the one longing of\n\ntheir hearts was to reach Hellas safely.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) I.e. \"his society was itself a passport to good fortune.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nIt was on the day after their meeting that Xenophon sacrificed as a\n\npreliminary to a military expedition; for it was needful to march out\n\nin search of provisions, besides which he designed burying the dead.    9\n\nAs soon as the victims proved favourable they all set out, the\n\nArcadians following with the rest. The majority of the dead, who had\n\nlain already five days, they buried just where they had fallen, in\n\ngroups; to remove their bodies now would have been impossible. Some\n\nfew, who lay off the roads, they got together and buried with what\n\nsplendour they could, considering the means in their power. Others\n\nthey could not find, and for these they erected a great cenotaph (2),\n\nand covered it with wreaths. When it was all done, they returned home\n\nto camp. At that time they supped, and went to rest.\n\n<br/><br/>", " (2) \"Cenotaph\", i.e. \"an empty tomb.\" The word is interesting as\n\n    occurring only in Xenophon, until we come to the writers of the\n\n    common dialect. Compare \"hyuscyamus,\" hogbean, our henbane, which\n\n    we also owe to Xenophon. \"Oecon.\" i. 13, see Sauppe, \"Lexil. Xen.\"\n\n    s.vv.\n\n<br/><br/>\nNext day there was a general meeting of the soldiers, collected\n\nchiefly by Agasias the Stymphalian, a captain, and Hieronymus, an\n\nEleian, also a captain, and other seniors of the Arcadians; and they\n\npassed a resolution that, for the future, whoever revived the idea of\n\nbreaking up the army should be punished by death. And the army, it was\n\ndecided, would now resume its old position under the command of its\n\nformer generals. Though Cheirisophus, indeed, had already died under\n\nmedical treatment for fever (3); and Neon the Asinaean had taken his\n\nplace.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (3) This I take to be the meaning of the words, which are necessarily\n\n    ambiguous, since {pharmakon}, \"a drug,\" also means \"poison.\" Did\n\n    Cheirisophus conceivably die of fever brought on by some poisonous\n\n    draught? or did he take poison whilst suffering from fever? or did\n\n    he die under treatment?\n\n<br/><br/>\nAfter these resolutions Xenophon got up and said: \"Soldiers, the\n\njourney must now, I presume, be conducted on foot; indeed, this is\n\nclear, since we have no vessels; and we are driven to commence it at\n\nonce, for we have no provisions if we stop. We then,\" he continued,\n\n\"will sacrifice, and you must prepare yourselves to fight now, if\n\never, for the spirit of the enemy has revived.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nThereupon the generals sacrificed, in the presence of the Arcadian\n", "seer, Arexion; for Silanus the Ambraciot had chartered a vessel at\n\nHeraclea and made his escape ere this. Sacrificing with a view to       13\n\ndeparture, the victims proved unfavourable to them. Accordingly they\n\nwaited that day. Certain people were bold enough to say that Xenophon,\n\nout of his desire to colonise the place, had persuaded the seer to say\n\nthat the victims were unfavourable to departure. Consequently he\n\nproclaimed by herald next morning that any one who liked should be\n\npresent at the sacrifice; or if he were a seer he was bidden to be\n\npresent and help to inspect the victims. Then he sacrificed, and there\n\nwere numbers present; but though the sacrifice on the question of\n\ndeparture was repeated as many as three times, the victims were\n\npersistently unfavourable. Thereat the soldiers were in high dudgeon,\n\nfor the provisions they had brought with them had reached the lowest\n\nebb, and there was no market to be had.\n\n<br/><br/>\nConsequently there was another meeting, and Xenophon spoke again:\n\n\"Men,\" said he, \"the victims are, as you may see for yourselves, not\n\nyet favourable to the march; but meanwhile, I can see for myself that\n\nyou are in need of provisions; accordingly we must narrow the\n\nsacrifice to the particular point.\" Some one got up and said:\n\n\"Naturally enough the victims are unfavourable, for, as I learnt from\n\nsome one on a vessel which arrived here yesterday by accident,\n\nCleander, the governor at Byzantium, intends coming here with ships\n\nand men-of-war.\" Thereat they were all in favour of stopping; but they\n\nmust needs go out for provisions, and with this object he again\n\nsacrificed three times, and the victims remained adverse. Things had\n\nnow reached such a pass that the men actually came to Xenophon's tent\n\nto proclaim that they had no provisions. His sole answer was that he\n\nwould not lead them out till the victims were favourable.\n\n<br/><br/>", "So again the next day he sacrificed; and nearly the whole army, so\n\nstrong was the general anxiety, flocked round the victims; and now the\n\nvery victims themselves failed. So the generals, instead of leading\n\nout the army, called the men together. Xenophon, as was incumbent on\n\nhim, spoke: \"It is quite possible that the enemy are collected in a\n\nbody, and we shall have to fight. If we were to leave our baggage in\n\nthe strong place\" (pointing overhead) \"and sally forth prepared for\n\nbattle, the victims might favour us.\" But the soldiers, on hearing      22\n\nthis proposal, cried out, \"No need to take us inside that place;\n\nbetter sacrifice with all speed.\" Now sheep there were none any\n\nlonger. So they purchased oxen from under a wagon and sacrificed; and\n\nXenophon begged Cleanor the Arcadian to superintend the sacrifice on\n\nhis behalf, in case there might be some change now. But even so there\n\nwas no improvement.\n\n<br/><br/>\nNow Neon was general in place of Cheirisophus, and seeing the men\n\nsuffering so cruelly from want, he was willing to do them a good turn.\n\nSo he got hold of some Heracleot or other who said he knew of villages\n\nclose by from which they could get provisions, and proclaimed by\n\nherald: \"If any one liked to come out and get provisions, be it known\n\nthat he, Neon, would be their leader.\" So out came the men with\n\nspears, and wine skins and sacks and other vessels--two thousand\n\nstrong in all. But when they had reached the villages and began to\n\nscatter for the purpose of foraging, Pharnabazus's cavalry were the\n\nfirst to fall upon them. They had come to the aid of the Bithynians,\n\nwishing, if possible, in conjunction with the latter, to hinder the\n\nHellenes from entering Phrygia. These troopers killed no less than\n\nfive hundred of the men; the rest fled for the lives up into the hill\n\ncountry.\n\n<br/><br/>", "News of the catastrophe was presently brought into camp by one of\n\nthose who had escaped, and Xenophon, seeing that the victims had not\n\nbeen favourable on that day, took a wagon bullock, in the absence of\n\nother sacrificial beasts, offered it up, and started for the rescue,\n\nhe and the rest under thirty years of age to the last man. Thus they\n\npicked up the remnant of Neon's party and returned to camp. It was now\n\nabout sunset; and the Hellenes in deep despondency were making their\n\nevening meal, when all of a sudden, through bush and brake, a party of\n\nBithynians fell upon the pickets, cutting down some and chasing the\n\nrest into camp. In the midst of screams and shouts the Hellenes ran to\n\ntheir arms, one and all; yet to pursue or move the camp in the night\n\nseemed hardly safe, for the ground was thickly grown with bush; all\n\nthey could do was to strengthen the outposts and keep watch under arms\n\nthe livelong night.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nV\n\n<br/><br/>\nAnd so they spent the night, but with day-dawn the generals led the     1\n\nway into the natural fastness, and the others picked up their arms and\n\nbaggage and followed the lead. Before the breakfast-hour arrived, they\n\nhad fenced off with a ditch the only side on which lay ingress into\n\nthe place, and had palisaded off the whole, leaving only three gates.\n\nAnon a ship from Heraclea arrived bringing barleymeal, victim animals,\n\nand wine.\n\n<br/><br/>\nXenophon was up betimes, and made the usual offering before starting\n\non an expedition, and at the first victim the sacrifice was\n", "favourable. Just as the sacrifice ended, the seer, Arexion the\n\nParrhasian, caught sight of an eagle, which boded well, and bade\n\nXenophon lead on. So they crossed the trench and grounded arms. Then\n\nproclamation was made by herald for the soldiers to breakfast and\n\nstart on an expedition under arms; the mob of sutlers and the captured\n\nslaves would be left in camp. Accordingly the mass of the troops set\n\nout. Neon alone remained; for it seemed best to leave that general and\n\nhis men to guard the contents of the camp. But when the officers and\n\nsoldiers had left them in the lurch, they were so ashamed to stop in\n\ncamp while the rest marched out, that they too set out, leaving only\n\nthose above five-and-forty years of age.\n\n<br/><br/>\nThese then stayed, while the rest set out on the march. Before they\n\nhad gone two miles, they stumbled upon dead bodies, and when they had\n\nbrought up the rear of the column in a line with the first bodies to\n\nbe seen, they began digging graves and burying all included in the\n\ncolumn from end to end. After burying the first batch, they advanced,\n\nand again bringing the rear even with the first unburied bodies which\n\nappeared, they buried in the same way all which the line of troops\n\nincluded. Finally, reaching the road that led out of the villages\n\nwhere the bodies lay thick together, they collected them and laid them\n\nin a common grave.\n\n<br/><br/>\nIt was now about midday, when pushing forward the troops up to the\n\nvillages without entering them, they proceeded to seize provisions,\n\nlaying hands on everything they could set eyes on under cover of their  7\n\nlines; when suddenly they caught sight of the enemy cresting certain\n\nhillocks in front of them, duly marshalled in line--a large body of\n\ncavalry and infantry. It was Spithridates and Rhathines, sent by\n\nPharnabazus with their force at their backs. As soon as the enemy\n", "caught sight of the Hellenes, they stood still, about two miles\n\ndistant. Then Arexion the seer sacrificed, and at the first essay the\n\nvictims were favourable. Whereupon Xenophon addressed the other\n\ngenerals: \"I would advise, sirs, that we should detach one or more\n\nflying columns to support our main attack, so that in case of need at\n\nany point we may have reserves in readiness to assist our main body,\n\nand the enemy, in the confusion of battle, may find himself attacking\n\nthe unbroken lines of troops not hitherto engaged.\" These views\n\napproved themselves to all. \"Do you then,\" said he, \"lead on the\n\nvanguard straight at the enemy. Do not let us stand parleying here,\n\nnow that we have caught sight of him and he of us. I will detach the\n\nhindmost companies in the way we have decided upon and follow you.\"\n\nAfter that they quietly advanced, and he, withdrawing the rear-rank\n\ncompanies in three brigades consisting of a couple of hundred men\n\napiece, commissioned the first on the right to follow the main body at\n\nthe distance of a hundred feet. Samolas the Achaean was in command of\n\nthis brigade. The duty of the second, under the command of Pyrrhias\n\nthe Arcadian, was to follow in the centre. The last was posted on the\n\nleft, with Phrasias, an Athenian, in command. As they advanced, the\n\nvanguard reached a large and difficult woody glen, and halted, not\n\nknowing whether the obstacle needed to be crossed or not. They passed\n\ndown the word for the generals and officers to come forward to the\n\nfront. Xenophon, wondering what it was that stopped the march, and\n\npresently hearing the above order passed along the ranks, rode up with\n\nall speed. As soon as they were met, Sophaenetus, as the eldest\n\ngeneral, stated his opinion that the question, whether a gully of that\n\nkind ought to be crossed or not, was not worth discussing. Xenophon,\n\nwith some ardour, retorted: \"You know, sirs, I have not been in the\n\nhabit hitherto of introducing you to danger which you might avoid. It\n\nis not your reputation for courage surely that is at stake, but your    14\n", "safe return home. But now the matter stands thus: It is impossible to\n\nretire from this point without a battle; if we do not advance against\n\nthe enemy ourselves, he will follow us as soon as we have turned our\n\nbacks and attack us. Consider, then; is it better to go and meet the\n\nfoe with arms advanced, or with arms reversed to watch him as he\n\nassails us on our rear? You know this at any rate, that to retire\n\nbefore an enemy has nothing glorious about it, whereas attack\n\nengenders courage even in a coward. For my part, I would rather at any\n\ntime attack with half my men than retreat with twice the number. As to\n\nthese fellows, if we attack them, I am sure you do not really expect\n\nthem to await us; though, if we retreat, we know for certain they will\n\nbe emboldened to pursue us. Nay, if the result of crossing is to place\n\na difficult gully behind us when we are on the point of engaging,\n\nsurely that is an advantage worth seizing. At least, if it were left\n\nto me, I would choose that everything should appear smooth and\n\npassable to the enemy, which may invite retreat; but for ourselves we\n\nmay bless the ground which teaches us that except in victory we have\n\nno deliverance. It astonishes me that any one should deem this\n\nparticular gully a whit more terrible than any of the other barriers\n\nwhich we have successfully passed. How impassable was the plain, had\n\nwe failed to conquer their cavalry! how insurmountable the mountains\n\nalready traversed by us, with all their peltasts in hot pursuit at our\n\nheels! Nay, when we have safely reached the sea, the Pontus will\n\npresent a somewhat formidable gully, when we have neither vessels to\n\nconvey us away nor corn to keep us alive whilst we stop. But we shall\n\nno sooner be there than we must be off again to get provisions. Surely\n\nit is better to fight to-day after a good breakfast than to-morrow on\n\nan empty stomach. Sirs, the offerings are favourable to us, the omens\n\nare propitious, the victims more than promising; let us attack the\n\nenemy! Now that they have had a good look at us, these fellows must\n", "not be allowed to enjoy their dinners or choose a camp at their own\n\nsweet will.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nAfter that the officers bade him lead on. None gainsaid, and he led\n\nthe way. His orders were to cross the gully, where each man chanced to  22\n\nfind himself. By this method, as it seemed to him, the troops would\n\nmore quickly mass themselves on the far side than was possible, if\n\nthey defiled along (1) the bridge which spanned the gully. But once\n\nacross he passed along the line and addressed the troops: \"Sirs, call\n\nto mind what by help of the gods you have already done. Bethink you of\n\nthe battles you have won at close quarters with the foe; of the fate\n\nwhich awaits those who flee before their foes. Forget not that we\n\nstand at the very doors of Hellas. Follow in the steps of Heracles,\n\nour guide, and cheer each the other onwards by name. Sweet were it\n\nsurely by some brave and noble word or deed, spoken or done this day,\n\nto leave the memory of oneself in the hearts of those one loves.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) Lit. \"had they wound off thread by thread\"; the metaphor is from\n\n    unwinding a ball of wool.\n\n<br/><br/>\nThese words were spoken as he rode past, and simultaneously he began\n\nleading on the troops in battle line; and, placing the peltasts on\n\neither flank of the main body, they moved against the enemy. Along the\n\nline the order had sped \"to keep their spears at rest on the right\n\nshoulder until the bugle signal; then lower them for the charge, slow\n\nmarch, and even pace, no one to quicken into a run.\" Lastly, the\n\nwatchword was passed, \"Zeus the Saviour, Heracles our Guide.\" The\n\nenemy waited their approach, confident in the excellence of his\n\nposition; but as they drew closer the Hellene light troops, with a\n\nloud alala! without waiting for the order, dashed against the foe. The\n", "latter, on their side, came forward eagerly to meet the charge, both\n\nthe cavalry and the mass of the Bithynians; and these turned the\n\npeltasts. But when with counter-wave the phalanx of the heavy infantry\n\nrapidly advancing, faced them, and at the same time the bugle sounded,\n\nand the battle hymn rose from all lips, and after this a loud cheer\n\nrose, and at the same instant they couched their spears;--at this\n\nconjuncture the enemy no longer welcomed them, but fled. Timasion with\n\nhis cavalry followed close, and, considering their scant numbers, they\n\ndid great execution. It was the left wing of the enemy, in a line with\n\nwhich the Hellene cavalry were posted, that was so speedily scattered.\n\nBut the right, which was not so hotly pursued, collected upon a knoll;  28\n\nand when the Hellenes saw them standing firm, it seemed the easiest\n\nand least dangerous course to go against them at once. Raising the\n\nbattle hymn, they straightway fell upon them, but the others did not\n\nawait their coming. Thereupon the peltasts gave chase until the right\n\nof the enemy was in its turn scattered, though with slight loss in\n\nkilled; for the enemy's cavalry was numerous and threatening.\n\n<br/><br/>\nBut when the Hellenes saw the cavalry of Pharnabazus still standing in\n\ncompact order, and the Bithynian horsemen massing together as if to\n\njoin it, and like spectators gazing down from a knoll at the\n\noccurrences below; though weary, they determined to attack the enemy\n\nas best they could, and not suffer him to recover breath with reviving\n\ncourage. So they formed in compact line and advanced. Thereupon the\n\nhostile cavalry turned and fled down the steep as swiftly as if they\n\nhad been pursued by cavalry. In fact they sought the shelter of a\n\ngully, the existence of which was unknown to the Hellenes. The latter\n\naccordingly turned aside too soon and gave up the chase, for it was\n\ntoo late. Returning to the point where the first encounter took place\n\nthey erected a trophy, and went back to the sea about sunset. It was\n", "something like seven miles to camp.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nVI\n\n<br/><br/>\nAfter this the enemy confined themselves to their own concerns, and     1\n\nremoved their households and property as far away as possible. The\n\nHellenes, on their side, were still awaiting the arrival of Cleander\n\nwith the ships of war and transports, which ought to be there soon. So\n\neach day they went out with the baggage animals and slaves and\n\nfearlessly brought in wheat and barley, wine and vegetables, millet\n\nand figs; since the district produced all good things, the olive alone\n\nexcepted. When the army stayed in camp to rest, pillaging parties were\n\nallowed to go out, and those who went out appropriated the spoils; but\n\nwhen the whole army went out, if any one went off apart and seized      2\n\nanything, it was voted to be public property. Ere long there was an\n\nample abundance of supplies of all sorts, for marketables arrived from\n\nHellenic cities on all sides, and marts were established. Mariners\n\ncoasting by, and hearing that a city was being founded and that there\n\nwas a harbour, were glad to put in. Even the hostile tribes dwelling\n\nin the neighbourhood presently began to send envoys to Xenophon. It\n\nwas he who was forming the place into a city, as they understood, and\n\nthey would be glad to learn on what terms they might secure his\n\nfriendship. He made a point of introducing these visitors to the\n\nsoldiers.\n\n<br/><br/>\nMeanwhile Cleander arrived with two ships of war, but not a single\n\ntransport. At the moment of his arrival, as it happened, the army had\n", "taken the field, and a separate party had gone off on a pillaging\n\nexpedition into the hills and had captured a number of small cattle.\n\nIn thir apprehension of being deprived of them, these same people\n\nspoke to Dexippus (this was the same man who had made off from\n\nTrapezus with the fifty-oared galley), and urged him to save their\n\nsheep for them. \"Take some for yourself,\" said they, \"and give the\n\nrest back to us.\" So, without more ado, he drove off the soldiers\n\nstanding near, who kept repeating that the spoil was public property.\n\nThen off he went to Cleander. \"Here is an attempt,\" said he, \"at\n\nrobbery.\" Cleander bade him to bring up the culprit to him. Dexippus\n\nseized on some one, and was for haling him to the Spartan governor.\n\nJust then Agasias came across him and rescued the man, who was a\n\nmember of his company; and the rest of the soldiers present set to\n\nwork to stone Dexippus, calling him \"traitor.\" Things looked so ill\n\nthat a number of the crew of the ships of war took fright and fled to\n\nthe sea, and with the rest Cleander himself. Xenophon and the other\n\ngenerals tried to hold the men back, assuring Cleander that the affair\n\nsignified nothing at all, and that the origin of it was a decree pased\n\nby the army. That was to blame, if anything. But Cleander, goaded by\n\nDexippus, and personally annoyed at the fright which he had\n\nexperienced, threatened to sail away and publish an interdict against\n\nthem, forbidding any city to receive them, as being public enemies.     9\n\nFor at this date the Lacedaemonians held sway over the whole Hellenic\n\nworld.\n\n<br/><br/>\nThereat the affair began to wear an ugly look, and the Hellenes begged\n\nand implored Cleander to reconsider his intention. He replied that he\n\nwould be as good as his word, and that nothing should stop him, unless\n\nthe man who set the example of stoning, with the other who rescued the\n\nprisoner, were given up to him. Now, one of the two whose persons were\n", "thus demanded--Agasias--had been a friend to Xenophon throughout; and\n\nthat was just why Dexippus was all the more anxious to accuse him. In\n\ntheir perplexity the generals summoned a full meeting of the soldiers,\n\nand some speakers were disposed to make very light of Cleander and set\n\nhim at naught. But Xenophon took a more serious view of the matter; he\n\nrose and addressed the meeting thus: \"Soldiers, I cannot say that I\n\nfeel disposed to make light of this business, if Cleander be allowed\n\nto go away, as he threatens to do, in his present temper towards us.\n\nThere are Hellenic cities close by; but then the Lacedaemonians are\n\nthe lords of Hellas, and they can, any one of them, carry out whatever\n\nthey like in the cities. If then the first thing this Lacedaemonian\n\ndoes is to close the gates of Byzantium, and next to pass an order to\n\nthe other governors, city by city, not to receive us because we are a\n\nset of lawless ruffians disloyal to the Lacedaemonians; and if,\n\nfurther, this report of us should reach the ears of their admiral,\n\nAnaxibius, to stay or to sail away will alike be difficult. Remember,\n\nthe Lacedaemonians at the present time are lords alike on land and on\n\nsea. For the sake then of a single man, or for two men's sake, it is\n\nnot right that the rest of us should be debarred from Hellas; but\n\nwhatever they enjoin we must obey. Do not the cities which gave us\n\nbirth yield them obedience also? For my own part, inasmuch as\n\nDexippus, I believe, keeps telling Cleander that Agasias would never\n\nhave done this had not I, Xenophon, bidden him, I absolve you of all\n\ncomplicity, and Agasias too, if Agasias himself states that I am in\n\nany way a prime mover in this matter. If I have set the fashion of\n\nstone-throwing or any other sort of violence I condemn myself--I say\n\nthat I deserve the extreme penalty, and I will submit to undergo it. I  15\n\nfurther say that if any one else is accused, that man is bound to\n\nsurrender himself to Cleander for judgement, for by this means you\n\nwill be absolved entirely from the accusation. But as the matter now\n", "stands, it is cruel that just when we were aspiring to win praise and\n\nhonour throughout Hellas, we are destined to sink below the level of\n\nthe rest of the world, banned from the Hellenic cities whose common\n\nname we boast.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nAfter him Agasias got up, and said, \"I swear to you, sirs, by the gods\n\nand goddesses, verily and indeed, neither Xenophon nor any one else\n\namong you bade me rescue the man. I saw an honest man--one of my own\n\ncompany--being taken up by Dexippus, the man who betrayed you, as you\n\nknow full well. That I could not endure; I rescued him, I admit the\n\nfact. Do not you deliver me up. I will surrender myself, as Xenophon\n\nsuggests, to Cleander to pass what verdict on me he thinks right. Do\n\nnot, for the sake of such a matter, make foes of the Lacedaemonians;\n\nrather God grant that (1) each of you may safely reach the goal of his\n\ndesire. Only do you choose from among yourselves and send with me to\n\nCleander those who, in case of any omission on my part, may by their\n\nwords and acts supply what is lacking.\" Thereupon the army granted him\n\nto choose for himself whom he would have go with him and to go; and he\n\nat once chose the generals. After this they all set off to\n\nCleander--Agasias and the generals and the man who had been rescued by\n\nAgasias--and the generals spoke as follows: \"The army has sent us to\n\nyou, Cleander, and this is their bidding: 'If you have fault to find\n\nwith all, they say, you ought to pass sentence on all, and do with\n\nthem what seems best; or if the charge is against one man or two, or\n\npossibly several, what they expect of these people is to surrender\n\nthemselves to you for judgement.' Accordingly, if you lay anything to\n\nthe charge of us generals, here we stand at your bar. Or do you impute\n\nthe fault to some one not here? tell us whom. Short of flying in the\n\nface of our authority, there is no one who will absent himself.\"\n\n<br/><br/>", " (1) Reading with the best MSS., {sozoisthe}. Agasias ends his sentence\n\n    with a prayer. Al. {sozesthe}, \"act so that each,\" etc.\n\n<br/><br/>\nAt this point Agasias stepped forward and said: \"It was I, Cleander,    21\n\nwho rescued the man before you yonder from Dexippus, when the latter\n\nwas carrying him off, and it was I who gave the order to strike\n\nDexippus. My plea is that I know the prisoner to be an honest man. As\n\nto Dexippus, I know that he was chosen by the army to command a\n\nfifty-oared galley, which we had obtained by request from the men of\n\nTrapezus for the express purpose of collecting vessels to carry us\n\nsafely home. But this same Dexippus betrayed his fellow-soldiers, with\n\nwhom he had been delivered from so many perils, and made off into\n\nhiding like a runaway slave, whereby we have robbed the Trapezuntines\n\nof their frigate, and must needs appear as knaves in their eyes for\n\nthis man's sake. As to ourselves, as far as he could, he has ruined\n\nus; for, like the rest of us, he had heard how all but impossible it\n\nwas for us to retreat by foot across the rivers and to reach Hellas in\n\nsafety. That is the stamp of man whom I robbed of his prey. Now, had\n\nit been you yourself who carried him off, or one of your emissaries,\n\nor indeed any one short of a runaway from ourselves, be sure that I\n\nshould have acted far otherwise. Be assured that if you put me to\n\ndeath at this time you are sacrificing a good, honest man for the sake\n\nof a coward and a scamp.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nWhen he had listened to these remarks, Cleander replied that if such\n\nhad been the conduct of Dexippus, he could not congratulate him. \"But\n\nstill,\" he added, turning to the generals, \"were Dexippus ever so\n\ngreat a scamp he ought not to suffer violence; but in the language of\n\nyour own demand he was entitled to a fair trial, and so to obtain his\n\ndeserts. What I have to say at present therefore is: leave your friend\n", "here and go your way, and when I give the order be present at the\n\ntrial. I have no further charge against the army or any one, since the\n\nprisoner himself admits that he rescued the man.\" Then the man who had\n\nbeen rescued said: \"In behalf of myself, Cleander, if possibly you\n\nthink that I was being taken up for some misdeed, it is not so; I\n\nneither struck nor shot; I merely said, 'The sheep are public\n\nproperty;' for it was a resolution of the soldiers that whenever the\n\narmy went out as a body any booty privately obtained was to be public\n\nproperty. That was all I said, and thereupon yonder fellow seized me    28\n\nand began dragging me off. He wanted to stop our mouths, so that he\n\nmight have a share of the things himself, and keep the rest for these\n\nbuccaneers, contrary to the ordinance.\" In answer to that Cleander\n\nsaid: \"Very well, if that is your disposition you can stay behind too,\n\nand we will take your case into consideration also.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nThereupon Cleander and his party proceeded to breakfast; but Xenophon\n\ncollected the army in assembly, and advised their sending a deputation\n\nto Cleander to intercede in behalf of the men. Accordingly it was\n\nresolved to send some generals and officers with Dracontius the\n\nSpartan, and of the rest those who seemed best fitted to go. The\n\ndeputation was to request Cleander by all means to release the two\n\nmen. Accordingly Xenophon came and addressed him thus: \"Cleander, you\n\nhave the men; the army has bowed to you and assented to do what you\n\nwished with respect to these two members of their body and themselves\n\nin general. But now they beg and pray you to give up these two men,\n\nand not to put them to death. Many a good service have these two\n\nwrought for our army in past days. Let them but obtain this from you,\n\nand in return the army promises that, if you will put yourself at\n\ntheir head and the gracious gods approve, they will show you how\n\norderly they are, how apt to obey their general, and, with heaven's\n", "help, to face their foes unflinchingly. They make this further request\n\nto you, that you will present yourself and take command of them and\n\nmake trial of them. 'Test us ourselves,' they say, 'and test Dexippus,\n\nwhat each of us is like, and afterwards assign to each his due.'\" When\n\nCleander heard these things, he answered: \"Nay, by the twin gods, I\n\nwill answer you quickly enough. Here I make you a present of the two\n\nmen, and I will as you say present myself, and then, if the gods\n\nvouchsafe, I will put myself at your head and lead you into Hellas.\n\nVery different is your language from the tale I used to hear\n\nconcerning you from certain people, that you wanted to withdraw the\n\narmy from allegiance to the Lacedaemonians.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nAfter this the deputation thanked him and retired, taking with them\n\nthe two men; then Cleander sacrificed as a preliminary to marching and\n\nconsorted friendlily with Xenophon, and the two struck up an alliance.  35\n\nWhen the Spartan saw with what good discipline the men carried out\n\ntheir orders, he was still more anxious to become their leader.\n\nHowever, in spite of sacrifices repeated on three successive days, the\n\nvictims steadily remained unfavourable. So he summoned the generals\n\nand said to them: \"The victims smile not on me, they suffer me not to\n\nlead you home; but be not out of heart at that. To you it is given, as\n\nit would appear, to bring your men safe home. Forwards then, and for\n\nour part, whenever you come yonder, we will bestow on you as warm a\n\nwelcome as we may.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nThen the soldiers resolved to make him a present of the public cattle,\n\nwhich he accepted, but again gave back to them. So he sailed away; but\n\nthe soldiers made division of the corn which they had collected and of\n\nthe other captured property, and commenced their homeward march\n\nthrough the territory of the Bithynians.\n", "<br/><br/>\nAt first they confined themselves to the main road; but not chancing\n\nupon anything whereby they might reach a friendly territory with\n\nsomething in their pockets for themselves, they resolved to turn sharp\n\nround, and marched for one day and night in the opposite direction. By\n\nthis proceeding they captured many slaves and much small cattle; and\n\non the sixth day reached Chrysopolis in Chalcedonia (2). Here they\n\nhalted seven days while they disposed of their booty by sale.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (2) The name should be written \"Calchedonia.\" The false form drove out\n\n    the more correct, probably through a mispronunciation, based on a\n\n    wrong derivation, at some date long ago. The sites of Chrysopolis\n\n    and Calchedon correspond respectively to the modern Scutari and\n\n    Kadikoi.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nBOOK VII\n\n<br/><br/>\n (In the earlier portion of the narrative will be found a\n\ndetailed history of the fortunes of the Hellenes during their\n\nmarch up country with Cyrus down to the date of the battle;\n\nand, subsequently to his death, until they reached the Euxine;\n\nas also of all their doings in their efforts to escape from\n\nthe Euxine, partly by land marches and partly under sail by\n\nsea, until they found themselves outside the mouth of the\n\nBlack Sea (south of the Bosphorus) at Chrysopolis in Asia.)\n\n<br/><br/>", "<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nI\n\n<br/><br/>\nAt this point Pharnabazus, who was afraid that the army might           1\n\nundertake a campaign against his satrapy, sent to Anaxibius, the\n\nSpartan high admiral, who chanced to be in Byzantium, and begged him\n\nto convey the army out of Asia, undertaking to comply with his wishes\n\nin every respect. Anaxibius accordingly sent to summon the generals\n\nand officers to Byzantium, and promised that the soldiers should not\n\nlack pay for service, if they crossed the strait. The officers said\n\nthat they would deliberate and return an answer. Xenophon individually\n\ninformed them that he was about to quit the army at once, and was only\n\nanxious to set sail. Anaxibius pressed him not to be in so great a\n\nhurry: \"Cross over with the rest,\" he said, \"and then it will be time\n\nenough to think about quitting the army.\" This the other undertook to\n\ndo.\n\n<br/><br/>\nNow Seuthes the Thracian sent Medosades and begged Xenophon to use his\n\ninfluence to get the army across. \"Tell Xenophon, if he will do his\n\nbest for me in this matter, he will not regret it.\" Xenophon answered:\n\n\"The army is in any case going to cross; so that, as far as that is\n\nconcerned, Seuthes is under no obligation to me or to any one else;     6\n\nbut as soon as it is once across, I personally shall be quit of it.\n\nLet Seuthes, therefore, as far as he may deem consistent with\n\nprudence, apply to those who are going to remain and will have a voice\n\nin affairs.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nAfter this the whole body of troops crossed to Byzantium. But\n", "Anaxibius, instead of proceeding to give pay, made proclamation that,\n\n\"The soldiers were to take up their arms and baggage and go forth,\" as\n\nif all he wished were to ascertain their numbers and bid them\n\ngod-speed at the same moment. The soldiers were not well pleased at\n\nthat, because they had no money to furnish themselves with provisions\n\nfor the march; and they sluggishly set about getting their baggage\n\ntogether. Xenophon meanwhile, being on terms of intimacy with the\n\ngovernor, Cleander, came to pay his host a final visit, and bid him\n\nadieu, being on the point of setting sail. But the other protested;\n\n\"Do not do so, or else,\" said he, \"you will be blamed, for even now\n\ncertain people are disposed to hold you to account because the army is\n\nso slow in getting under weigh.\" The other answered, \"Nay, I am not to\n\nblame for that. It is the men themselves, who are in want of\n\nprovisions; that is why they are out of heart at their exodus.\" \"All\n\nthe same,\" he replied, \"I advise you to go out, as if you intended to\n\nmarch with them, and when you are well outside, it will be time enough\n\nto take yourself off.\" \"Well then,\" said Xenophon, \"we will go and\n\narrange all this with Anaxibius.\" They went and stated the case to the\n\nadmiral, who insisted that they must do as he had said, and march out,\n\nbag and baggage, by the quickest road; and as an appendix to the\n\nformer edict, he added, \"Any one absenting himself from the review and\n\nthe muster will have himself to blame for the consequences.\" This was\n\nperemptory. So out marched, the generals first, and then the rest; and\n\nnow, with the exception of here a man and there, they were all\n\noutside; it was a \"clean sweep\"; and Eteonicus stood posted near the\n\ngates, ready to close them, as soon as the men were fairly out, and to\n\nthrust in the bolt pin.\n\n<br/><br/>\nThen Anaxibius summoned the generals and captains, and addressed them:\n\n\"Provisions you had better get from the Thracian villages; you will     13\n", "find plenty of barley, wheat, and other necessaries in them; and when\n\nyou have got them, off with you to the Chersonese, where Cyniscus will\n\ntake you into his service.\" Some of the soldiers overheard what was\n\nsaid, or possibly one of the officers was the medium of communication;\n\nhowever it was, the news was handed on to the army. As to the\n\ngenerals, their immediate concern was to try and gain some information\n\nas to Seuthes: \"Was he hostile or friendly? also, would they have to\n\nmarch through the Sacred mountain (1), or round about through the\n\nmiddle of Thrace?\"\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) So the mountain-range is named which runs parallel to the\n\n    Propontis (Sea of Marmora) from lat. 41 degrees N. circa to lat.\n\n    40 degrees 30'; from Bisanthe (Rhodosto) to the neck of the\n\n    Chersonese (Gallipoli).\n\n<br/><br/>\nWhile they were discussing these points, the soldiers snatched up\n\ntheir arms and made a rush full speed at the gates, with the intention\n\nof getting inside the fortification again. But Eteonicus and his men,\n\nseeing the heavy infantry coming up at a run promptly closed the gates\n\nand thrust in the bolt pin. Then the soldiers fell to battering the\n\ngates, exclaiming that it was iniquitous to thrust them forth in this\n\nfashion into the jaws of their enemies. \"If you do not of your own\n\naccord open the gates,\" they cried, \"we will split them in half\"; and\n\nanother set rushed down to the sea, and so along the break-water and\n\nover the wall into the city; while a third set, consisting of those\n\nfew who were still inside, having never left the city, seeing the\n\naffair at the gates, severed the bars with axes and flung the portals\n\nwide open; and the rest came pouring in.\n\n<br/><br/>\nXenophon, seeing what was happening, was seized with alarm lest the\n", "army betake itself to pillage, and ills incurable be wrought to the\n\ncity, to himself, and to the soldiers. Then he set off, and, plunging\n\ninto the throng, was swept through the gates with the crowd. The\n\nByzantines no sooner saw the soldiers forcibly rushing in than they\n\nleft the open square, and fled, some to the shipping, others to their\n\nhomes, while those already indoors came racing out, and some fell to\n\ndragging down their ships of war, hoping possibly to be safe on board\n\nthese; while there was not a soul who doubted but that the city was     19\n\ntaken, and that they were all undone. Eteonicus made a swift retreat\n\nto the citadel. Anaxibius ran down to the sea, and, getting on board a\n\nfisherman's smack, sailed round to the acropolis, and at once sent off\n\nto fetch over the garrison troops from Chalcedon, since those already\n\nin the acropolis seemed hardly sufficient to keep the men in check.\n\n<br/><br/>\nThe soldiers, catching sight of Xenophon, threw themselves upon him,\n\ncrying: \"Now, Xenophon, is the time to prove yourself a man. You have\n\ngot a city, you have got triremes, you have got money, you have got\n\nmen; to-day, if you only chose, you can do us a good turn, and we will\n\nmake you a great man.\" He replied: \"Nay, I like what you say, and I\n\nwill do it all; but if that is what you have set your hearts on, fall\n\ninto rank and take up position at once.\" This he said, wishing to\n\nquiet them, and so passed the order along the lines himself, while\n\nbidding the rest to do the same: \"Take up position; stand easy.\" But\n\nthe men themselves, by a species of self-marshalling, fell into rank,\n\nand were soon formed, the heavy infantry eight deep, while the light\n\ninfantry had run up to cover either wing. The Thracian Square, as it\n\nis called, is a fine site for manouvering, being bare of buildings and\n\nlevel. As soon as the arms were stacked and the men's tempers cooled,\n\nXenophon called a general meeting of the soldiers, and made the\n\nfollowing speech:--\n", "<br/><br/>\n\"Soldiers, I am not surprised at your wrath, or that you deem it\n\nmonstrous treatment so to be cheated; but consider what will be the\n\nconsequences if we gratify our indignation, and in return for such\n\ndeception, avenge ourselves on the Lacedaemonians here present, and\n\nplunder an innocent city. We shall be declared enemies of the\n\nLacedaemonians and their allies; and what sort of war that will be, we\n\nneed not go far to conjecture. I take it, you have not forgotten some\n\nquite recent occurrences. We Athenians entered into war against the\n\nLacedaemonians and their allies with a fleet consisting of not less\n\nthan three hundred line-of-battle ships, including those in dock as\n\nwell as those afloat. We had vast treasures stored up in the city, and\n\na yearly income which, derived from home or foreign sources, amounted\n\nto no less than a thousand talents. Our empire included all the         27\n\nislands, and we were possessed of numerous cities both in Asia and in\n\nEurope. Amongst others, this very Byzantium, where we are now, was\n\nours; and yet in the end we were vanquished, as you all very well\n\nknow.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"What, must we anticipate, will now be our fate? The Lacedaemonians\n\nhave not only their old allies, but the Athenians and those who were\n\nat that time allies of Athens are added to them. Tissaphernes and all\n\nthe rest of the Asiatics on the seaboard are our foes, not to speak of\n\nour arch-enemy, the king himself, up yonder, whom we came to deprive\n\nof his empire, and to kill, if possible. I ask then, with all these\n\nbanded together against us, is there any one so insensate as to\n\nimagine that we can survive the contest? For heaven's sake, let us not\n\ngo mad or loosely throw away our lives in war with our own native\n\ncities--nay, our own friends, our kith and our kin; for in one or\n\nother of the cities they are all included. Every city will march\n", "against us, and not unjustly, if, after refusing to hold one single\n\nbarbarian city by right of conquest, we seize the first Hellenic city\n\nthat we come to and make it a ruinous heap. For my part, my prayer is\n\nthat before I see such things wrought by you, I, at any rate, may lie\n\nten thousand fathoms under ground! My counsel to you, as Hellenes, is\n\nto try and obtain your just rights, through obedience to those who\n\nstand at the head of Hellas; and if so be that you fail in those\n\ndemands, why, being more sinned against than sinning, need we rob\n\nourselves of Hellas too? At present, I propose that we should send to\n\nAnaxibius and tell him that we have made an entrance into the city,\n\nnot meditating violence, but merely to discover if he and his will\n\nshow us any good; for if so, it is well; but of otherwise, at least we\n\nwill let him see that he does not shut the door upon us as dupes and\n\nfools. We know the meaning of discipline; we turn our backs and go.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nThis resolution was passed, and they sent Hieronymus an Eleian, with\n\ntwo others, Eurylochus an Arcadian and Philesius an Achaean, to\n\ndeliver the message. So these set off on their errand. But while the\n\nsoldiers were still seated in conclave, Coeratadas, of Thebes,          33\n\narrived. He was a Theban not in exile, but with a taste for\n\ngeneralship, who made it his business to see if any city or nation\n\nwere in need of his services. Thus, on the present occasion, he\n\npresented himself, and begged to state that he was ready to put\n\nhimself at their head, and lead them into the Delta of Thrace (2), as\n\nit is called, where they would find themselves in a land of plenty;\n\nbut until they got there, he would provide them with meat and drink\n\nenough and to spare. While they were still listening to this tale, the\n\nreturn message from Anaxibius came. His answer was: \"The discipline,\n\nthey had spoken of, was not a thing they would regret; indeed he would\n\nreport their behaviour to the authorities at home; and for himself, he\n", "would take advice and do the best he could for them.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\n (2) The exact locality, so called, is not known; doubtless it lay\n\n    somewhere between Byzantium and Salmydessus, possibly at Declus\n\n    (mod. Derkos); or possibly the narrow portion of Thrace between\n\n    the Euxine, Bosphorus, and Propontis went by this name. See note\n\n    in Pretor ad. loc., and \"Dict. Geog.\" \"Thracia.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nThereupon the soldiers accepted Coeratadas as their general, and\n\nretired without the walls. Their new general undertook to present\n\nhimself to the troops next day with sacrificial beasts and a\n\nsoothsayer, with eatables also and drinkables for the army. Now, as\n\nsoon as they were gone out, Anaxibius closed the gates and issued a\n\nproclamation to the effect that \"any of the soldiers caught inside\n\nshould be knocked down to the hammer and sold at once.\" Next day,\n\nCoeratadas arrived with the victims and the soothsayer. A string of\n\ntwenty bearers bearing barleymeal followed at his heels, succeeded by\n\nother twenty carrying wine, and three laden with a supply of olives,\n\nand two others carrying, the one about as much garlic as a single man\n\ncould lift, and the other a similar load of onions. These various\n\nsupplies he set down, apparently for distribution, and began to\n\nsacrifice.\n\n<br/><br/>\nNow Xenophon sent to Cleander, begging him to arrange matters so that\n\nhe might be allowed to enter the walls, with a view to starting from\n\nByzantium on his homeward voyage. Cleander came, and this is what he    39\n\nsaid: \"I have come; but I was barely able to arrange what you want.\n\nAnaxibius insisted: 'It was not convenient that Xenophon should be\n\ninside while the soldiers are close to the walls without; the\n\nByzantines at sixes and sevens moreover; and no love lost between the\n", "one party of them and the other.' Still, he ended by bidding you to\n\ncome inside, if you were really minded to leave the town by sea with\n\nhimself.\" Accordingly Xenophon bade the soldiers good-bye, and\n\nreturned with Cleander within the walls.\n\n<br/><br/>\nTo return to Coeratadas. The first day he failed to get favourable\n\nsigns at the sacrifice, and never a dole of rations did he make to the\n\nsoldiers. On the second day the victims were standing ready near the\n\naltar, and so was Coeratadas, with chaplet crowned, all ready to\n\nsacrifice, when up comes Timasion the Dardanian, with Neon the\n\nAsinaean, and Cleanor of Orchomenus, forbidding Coeratadas to\n\nsacrifice: \"He must understand there was an end to his generalship,\n\nunless he gave them provisions.\" The other bade them measure out the\n\nsupplies, \"Pray, dole them out.\" But when he found that he had a good\n\ndeal short of a single day's provisions for each man, he picked up his\n\nparaphernalia of sacrifice and withdrew. As to being general, he would\n\nhave nothing more to say to it.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nII\n\n<br/><br/>\nNow these five were left--Neon the Asinaean, Phryniscus the Achaean,    1\n\nPhilesius the Achaean, Xanthicles the Achaean, Timasion the\n\nDardanian--at the head of the army, and they pushed on to some\n\nvillages of the Thracians facing Byzantium, and there encamped. Now\n\nthe generals could not agree. Cleanor and Phryniscus wished to march\n\nto join Seuthes, who had worked upon their feelings by presenting one\n\nwith a horse and the other with a woman to wife. But Neon's object was\n", "to come to the Chersonese: \"When we are under the wing of the\n\nLacedaemonians,\" he thought, \"I shall step to the front and command\n\nthe whole army.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nTimasion's one ambition was to cross back again into Asia, hoping to\n\nbe reinstated at home and end his exile. The soldiers shared the\n\nwishes of the last general. But, as time dragged on, many of the men\n\nsold their arms at different places and set sail as best they could;\n\nothers  (actually gave away their arms, some here, some there, and (1))   3\n\nbecame absorbed in the cities. One man rejoiced. This was Anaxibius,\n\nto whom the break-up of the army was a blessing. \"That is the way,\" he\n\nsaid to himself, \"I can best gratify Pharnabazus.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) The MSS. give the words so rendered--{oi de kai  (didontes ta opla\n\n    kata tous khorous)}, which some critics emend {diadidontes},\n\n    others bracket as suspected, others expunge.\n\n<br/><br/>\nBut Anaxibius, while prosecuting his voyage from Byzantium, was met at\n\nCyzicus by Aristarchus, the new governor, who was to succeed Cleander\n\nat Byzantium; and report said that a new admiral, Polus, if he had not\n\nactually arrived, would presently reach the Hellespont and relieve\n\nAnaxibius. The latter sent a parting injunction to Aristarchus to be\n\nsure and sell all the Cyreian soldiers he could lay hands on still\n\nlingering in Byzantium; for Cleander had not sold a single man of\n\nthem; on the contrary, he had made it his business to tend the sick\n\nand wounded, pitying them, and insisting on their being received in\n\nthe houses. Aristarchus changed all that, and was no sooner arrived in\n\nByzantium than he sold no less than four hundred of them. Meanwhile\n\nAnaxibius, on his coasting voyage, reached Parium, and, according to\n\nthe terms of their agreement, he sent to Pharnabazus. But the latter,\n", "learning that Aristarchus was the new governor at Byzantim, and that\n\nAnixibius had ceased to be admiral, turned upon him a cold shoulder,\n\nand set out concocting the same measures concerning the Cyreian army\n\nwith Aristarchus, as he had lately been at work upon with Anaxibius.\n\n<br/><br/>\nAnaxibius thereupon summoned Xenophon and bade him, by every manner of\n\nmeans, sail to the army with the utmost speed, and keep it together.\n\n\"He was to collect the scattered fragments and march them down to\n\nPerinthus, and thence convey them across to Asia without loss of\n\ntime.\" And herewith he put a thirty-oared galley at his service, and\n\ngave him a letter of authority and an officer to accompany him, with\n\nan order to the Perinthians \"to escort Xenophon without delay on\n\nhorseback to the army.\" So it was that Xenophon sailed across and\n\neventually reached the army. The soldiers gave him a joyous welcome,\n\nand would have been only too glad to cross from Thrace into Asia under\n\nhis leadership.\n\n<br/><br/>\nBut Seuthes, hearing that Xenophon had arrived, sent Medosades again,   10\n\nby sea to meet him, and begged him to bring the army to him; and\n\nwhatever he thought would make his speech persuasive, he was ready to\n\npromise him. But the other replied, that none of these things were\n\nopen to him to do; and with this answer Medosades departed, and the\n\nHellenes proceeded to Perinthus. Here on arrival Neon withdrew his\n\ntroops and encamped apart, having about eight hundred men; while the\n\nremainder of the army lay in one place under the walls of Perinthus.\n\n<br/><br/>\nAfter this, Xenophon set himself to find vessels, so as to lose no\n\ntime in crossing. But in the interval Aristarchus, the governor from\n\nByzantium, arrived with a couple of war-ships, being moved to do so by\n\nPharnabazus. To make doubly sure, he first forbade the skippers and\n", "shipmasters to carry the troops across, and then he visited the camp\n\nand informed the soldiers that their passage into Asia was forbidden.\n\nXenophon replied that he was acting under the orders of Anaxibius, who\n\nhad sent him thither for this express purpose; to which Aristarchus\n\nretorted, \"For the matter of that, Anaxibius is no longer admiral, and\n\nI am governor in this quarter; if I catch any of you at sea, I will\n\nsink you.\" With these remarks he retired within the walls of\n\nPerinthus.\n\n<br/><br/>\nNext day, he sent for the generals and officers of the army. They had\n\nalready reached the fortification walls, when some one brought word to\n\nXenophon that if he set foot inside, he would be seized, and either\n\nmeet some ill fate there or more likely be delivered up to\n\nPharnabazus. On hearing this Xenophon sent forward the rest of the\n\nparty, but for himself pleaded that there was a sacrifice which he\n\nwished to offer. In this way he contrived to turn back and consult the\n\nvictims, \"Would the gods allow him to try and bring the army over to\n\nSeuthes?\" On the one hand it was plain that the idea of crossing over\n\nto Asia in the face of this man with his ships of war, who meant to\n\nbar the passage, was too dangerous. Nor did he altogether like the\n\nnotion of being blocked up in the Chersonese with an army in dire need\n\nof everything; where, besides being at the beck and call of the         15\n\ngovernor of the place, they would be debarred from the necessities of\n\nlife.\n\n<br/><br/>\nWhile Xenophon was thus employed, the generals and officers came back\n\nwith a message from Aristarchus, who had told them they might retire\n\nfor the present, but in the afternoon he would expect them. The former\n\nsuspicions of a plot had now ripened to a certainty. Xenophon meantime\n\nhad ascertained that the victims were favourable to his project. He\n", "personally, and the army as a whole, might with safety proceed to\n\nSeuthes, they seemed to say. Accordingly, he took with him Polycrates,\n\nthe Athenian captain, and from each of the generals, not including\n\nNeon, some one man whom they could in each case trust, and in the\n\nnight they set off to visit the army of Seuthes, sixty furlongs\n\ndistant.\n\n<br/><br/>\nAs they approached, they came upon some deserted watch-fires, and\n\ntheir first impression was that Seuthes had shifted his position; but\n\npresently perceiving a confused sound (the voices of Seuthes' people\n\nsignalling to one another), the explanation dawned on him: Seuthes\n\nkept his watch-fires kindled in front of, instead of behind, his night\n\npickets, in order that the outposts, being in the dark, might escape\n\nnotice, their numbers and position thus being a mystery; whilst any\n\nparty approaching from the outside, so far from escaping notice,\n\nwould, through the glare of the fire, stand out conspicuously.\n\nPerceiving how matters stood, Xenophon sent forward his interpreter,\n\nwho was one of the party, and bade him inform Seuthes that Xenophon\n\nwas there and craved conference with him. The others asked if he were\n\nan Athenian from the army yonder, and no sooner had the interpreter\n\nreplied, \"Yes, the same,\" than up they leapt and galloped off; and in\n\nless time than it takes to tell a couple of hundred peltasts had come\n\nup who seized and carried off Xenophon and those with him and brought\n\nthem to Seuthes. The latter was in a tower right well guarded, and\n\nthere were horses round it in a circle, standing all ready bitted and\n\nbridled; for his alarm was so great that he gave his horses their\n\nprovender during the day (2), and during the nights he kept watch and    21\n\nward with the brutes thus bitted and bridled. It was stated in\n\nexplanation that in old days an ancestor of his, named Teres, had been\n\nin this very country with a large army, several of whom he had lost at\n", "the hands of the native inhabitants, besides being robbed of his\n\nbaggage train. The inhabitants of the country are Thynians, and they\n\nare reputed to be far the most warlike set of fighters--especially at\n\nnight.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (2) I.e. \"instead of letting them graze.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nWhen they drew near, Seuthes bade Xenophon enter, and bring with him\n\nany two he might choose. As soon as they were inside, they first\n\ngreeted one another warmly, and then, according to the Thracian\n\ncustom, pledged themselves in bowls of wine. There was further present\n\nat the elbow of Seuthes, Medosades, who on all occasions acted as his\n\nambassador-in-chief. Xenophon took the initiative and spoke as\n\nfollows: \"You have sent to me, Seuthes, once and again. On the first\n\noccasion you sent Medosades yonder, to Chalcedon, and you begged me to\n\nuse my influence in favour of the army crossing over from Asia. You\n\npromised me, in return for this conduct on my part, various\n\nkindnesses; at least that is what Medosades stated\"; and before\n\nproceeding further he turned to Medosades and asked, \"Is not that so?\"\n\nThe other assented. \"Again, on a second occasion, the same Medosades\n\ncame when I had crossed over from Parium to rejoin the army; and he\n\npromised me that if I would bring you the army, you would in various\n\nrespects treat me as a friend and brother. He said especially with\n\nregard to certain seaboard places of which you are the owner and lord,\n\nthat you were minded to make me a present of them.\" At this point he\n\nagain questioned Medosades, \"Whether the words attributed to him were\n\nexact?\" and Medosades once more fully assented. \"Come now,\" proceeded\n\nXenophon, \"recount what answer I made you, and first at Chalcedon.\"\n\n\"You answered that the army was, in any case, about to cross over to\n\nByzantium; and as far as that went, there was no need to pay you or\n", "any one else anything; and for yourself, you added, that once across\n\nyou were minded to leave the army, which thing came to pass even as\n\nyou said.\" \"Well! what did I say,\" he asked, \"at your next visit, when  28\n\nyou came to me in Selybria?\" \"You said that the proposal was\n\nimpossible; you were all going to Perinthus to cross into Asia.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Xenophon, \"and in spite of it all, at the present moment,\n\nhere I am myself, and Phryniscus, one of my colleagues, and Polycrates\n\nyonder, a captain; and outside, to represent the other generals (all\n\nexcept Neon the Laconian), the trustiest men they could find to send.\n\nSo that if you wish to give these transactions the seal of still\n\ngreater security, you have nothing to do but to summon them also; and\n\ndo you, Polycrates, go and say from me, that I bid them leave their\n\narms outside, and you can leave your own sword outside before you\n\nenter with them on your return.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nWhen Seuthes had heard so far, he interposed: \"I should never mistrust\n\nan Athenian, for we are relatives already (3), I know; and the best of\n\nfriends, I believe, we shall be.\" After that, as soon as the right men\n\nentered, Xenophon first questioned Seuthes as to what use he intended\n\nto make of the army, and he replied as follows: \"Maesades was my\n\nfather; his sway extended over the Melanditae, the Thynians, and the\n\nTranipsae. Then the affairs of the Odrysians took a bad turn, and my\n\nfather was driven out of this country, and later on died himself of\n\nsickness, leaving me to be brought up as an orphan at the court of\n\nMedocus, the present king. But I, when I had grown to man's estate,\n\ncould not endure to live with my eyes fixed on another's board. So I\n\nseated myself on the seat by him as a suppliant, and begged him to\n\ngive me as many men as he could spare, that I might wreak what\n\nmischief I could on those who had driven us forth from our land; that\n\nthus I might cease to live in dependence upon another's board, like a\n", "dog watching his master's hand. In answer to my petition, he gave me    34\n\nthe men and the horses which you will see at break of day, and\n\nnowadays I live with these, pillaging my own ancestral land. But if\n\nyou would join me, I think, with the help of heaven, we might easily\n\nrecover my empire. That is what I want of you.\" \"Well then,\" said\n\nXenophon, \"supposing we came, what should you be able to give us? the\n\nsoldiers, the officers, and the generals? Tell us that these witnesses\n\nmay report your answer.\" And he promised to give \"to the common\n\nsoldiers a cyzicene (4), to a captain twice as much, and to a general\n\nfour times as much, with as much land as ever they liked, some yoke of\n\noxen, and a fortified place upon the seaboard.\" \"But now supposing,\"\n\nsaid Xenophon, \"we fail of success, in spite of our endeavours;\n\nsuppose any intimidation on the part of the Lacedaemonians should\n\narise; will you receive into your country any of us who may seek to\n\nfind a refuge with you?\" He answered: \"Nay, not only so, but I shall\n\nlook upon you as my brothers, entitled to share my seat, and the joint\n\npossessors of all the wealth which we may be able to acquire. And to\n\nyou yourself, O Xenophon! I will give my daughter, and if you have a\n\ndaughter, I will buy her in Thracian fashion; and I will give you\n\nBisanthe as a dwelling-place, which is the fairest of all my\n\npossessions on the seaboard (5).\"\n\n<br/><br/>\n (3) Tradition said that the Thracians and Athenians were connected,\n\n    through the marriage of a former prince Tereus (or Teres) with\n\n    Procne, the daughter of Pandion. This old story, discredited by\n\n    Thucydides, ii. 29, is referred to in Arist. \"Birds,\" 368 foll.\n\n    The Birds are about to charge the two Athenian intruders, when\n\n    Epops, king of the Birds, formerly Tereus, king of Thrace, but\n\n    long ago transformed into a hoopoe, intercedes in behalf of two\n\n    men, {tes emes gunaikos onte suggene kai phuleta}, \"who are of my\n", "    lady's tribe and kin.\" As a matter of history, the Athenians had\n\n    in the year B.C. 431 made alliance with Sitalces, king of the\n\n    Odrysians (the son of Teres, the first founder of their empire),\n\n    and made his son, Sadocus, an Athenian citizen. Cf. Thuc. ib.;\n\n    Arist. Acharnians, 141 foll.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (4) A cyzicene monthly is to be understood.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (5) Bisanthe, one of the Ionic colonies founded by Samos, with the\n\n    Thracian name Rhaedestus (now Rodosto), strongly placed so as to\n\n    command the entrance into the Sacred mountain.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nIII\n\n<br/><br/>\nAfter listening to these proposals, they gave and accepted pledges of   1\n\ngood faith; and so the deputation rode off. Before day they were back\n\nagain in camp, and severally rendered a report to those who sent them.\n\nAt dawn Aristarchus again summoned the generals and officers, but the\n\nlatter resolved to have done with the visit to Aristarchus, and to\n\nsummon a meeting of the army. In full conclave the soldiers met, with\n\nthe exception of Neon's men, who remained about ten furlongs off. When\n\nthey were met together Xenophon rose, and made the following\n\nannouncement: \"Men, Aristarchus with his ships of war hinders us from\n\nsailing where we fain would go; it is not even safe to set foot on      3\n\nboard a vessel. But if he hinders us here, he hastens us there. 'Be\n\noff to the Chersonese,' says he, 'force a passage through the Sacred\n\nmountain.' If we master it and succeed in getting to that place, he\n", "has something in store for us. He promises that he will not sell you\n\nany more, as he did at Byzantium; you shall not be cheated again; you\n\nshall have pay; he will no longer, as now, suffer you to remain in\n\nwant of provisions. That is his proposal. But Seuthes says that if you\n\nwill go to him he will treat you well. What you have now to consider\n\nis, whether you will stay to debate this question, or leave its\n\nsettlement till we have gone up into a land of provisions. If you ask\n\nme my opinion, it is this: Since here we have neither money to buy,\n\nnor leave to take without money what we need, why should we not go up\n\ninto these villages where the right to help ourselves is conferred by\n\nmight? There, unhampered by the want of bare necessaries, you can\n\nlisten to what this man and the other wants of you and choose\n\nwhichever sounds best. Let those,\" he added, \"who agree to this, hold\n\nup their hands.\" They all held them up. \"Retire then,\" said he, \"and\n\nget your kit together, and at the word of command, follow your\n\nleader.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nAfter this, Xenophon put himself at the head and the rest followed.\n\nNeon, indeed, and other agents from Aristarchus tried to turn them\n\nfrom their purpose, but to their persuasions they turned a deaf ear.\n\nThey had not advanced much more than three miles, when Seuthes met\n\nthem; and Xenophon, seeing him, bade him ride up. He wished to tell\n\nhim what they felt to be conducive to their interests, and in the\n\npresence of as many witnesses as possible. As soon as he had\n\napproached, Xenophon said: \"We are going where the troops will have\n\nenough to live upon; when we are there, we will listen to you and to\n\nthe emissaries of the Laconian, and choose between you both whatever\n\nseems best. If then you will lead us where provisions are to be got in\n\nplenty, we shall feel indebted to you for your hospitality.\" And\n\nSeuthes answered: \"For the matter of that, I know many villages,\n", "close-packed and stocked with all kinds of provisions, just far enough  9\n\noff to give you a good appetite for your breakfasts.\" \"Lead on then!\"\n\nsaid Xenophon. When they had reached the villages in the afternoon,\n\nthe soldiers met, and Seuthes made the following speech: \"My request\n\nto you, sirs, is that you will take the field with me, and my promise\n\nto you is that I will give every man of you a cyzicene, and to the\n\nofficers and generals at the customary rate; besides this I will\n\nhonour those who show special merit. Food and drink you shall get as\n\nnow for yourselves from the country; but whatever is captured, I shall\n\nclaim to have myself, so that by distribution of it I may provide you\n\nwith pay. Let them flee, let them creep into hiding-places, we shall\n\nbe able to pursue after them, we will track them out; or if they\n\nresist, along with you we will endeavour to subdue them to our hands.\"\n\nXenophon inquired: \"And how far from the sea shall you expect the army\n\nto follow you?\" \"Nowhere more than seven days' journey,\" he answered,\n\n\"and in many places less.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nAfter this, permission was given for all who wished to speak, and many\n\nspoke, but ever to one and the same tune: \"What Seuthes said, was very\n\nright. It was winter, and for a man to sail home, even if he had the\n\nwill to do so, was impossible. On the other hand, to continue long in\n\na friendly country, where they must depend upon what they could\n\npurchase, was equally beyond their power. If they were to wear away\n\ntime and support life in a hostile country, it was safer to do so with\n\nSeuthes than by themselves, not to speak of all these good things; but\n\nif they were going to get pay into the bargain, that indeed was a\n\ngodsend.\" To complete the proceedings, Xenophon said: \"If any one\n\nopposes the measure, let him state his views; if not, let the officer\n\nput the proposition to the vote.\" No one opposed; they put it to the\n\nvote, and the resolution was carried; and without loss of time, he\n", "informed Seuthes that they would take the field with him.\n\n<br/><br/>\nAfter this the troops messed in their separate divisions, but the\n\ngenerals and officers were invited by Seuthes to dinner at a\n\nneighbouring village which was in his possession. When they were at\n\nthe doors, and on the point of stepping in to dinner, they were met by  16\n\na certain Heracleides, of Maronea (1). He came up to each guest,\n\naddressing himself particularly to those who, as he conjectured, ought\n\nto be able to make a present to Seuthes. He addressed himself first to\n\nsome Parians who were there to arrange a friendship with Medocus, the\n\nking of the Odrysians, and were bearers of presents to the king and to\n\nhis wife. Heracleides reminded them: \"Medocus is up country twelve\n\ndays' journey from the sea; but Seuthes, now that he has got this\n\narmy, will be lord on the sea-coast; as your neighbour, then, he is\n\nthe man to do you good or do you ill. If you are wise, you will give\n\nhim whatever he askes of you. On the whole, it will be laid out at\n\nbetter interest than if you have it to Medocus, who lives so far off.\"\n\nThat was his mode of persuasion in their case. Next he came to\n\nTimasion the Dardanian, who, some one had told him, was the happy\n\npossessor of certain goblets and oriental carpets. What he said to him\n\nwas: \"It is customary when people are invited to dinner by Seuthes for\n\nthe guests to make him a present; now if he should become a great\n\nperson in these parts, he will be able to restore you to your native\n\nland, or to make you a rich man here.\" Such were the solicitations\n\nwhich he applied to each man in turn whom he accosted. Presently he\n\ncame to Xenophon and said: \"You are at once a citizen of no mean city,\n\nand with Seuthes also your own name is very great. Maybe you expect to\n\nobtain a fort or two in this country, just as others of your\n\ncountrymen have done (2), and territory. It is only right and proper\n\ntherefore that you should honour Seuthes in the most magnificent\n", "style. Be sure, I give this advice out of pure friendliness, for I\n\nknow that the greater the gift that you are ready to bestow on him,\n\nthe better the treatment you will receive at his hands.\" Xenophon, on\n\nhearing this, was in a sad dilemma, for he had brought with him, when\n\nhe crossed from Parium, nothing but one boy and just enough to pay his\n\ntravelling expenses.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) A Greek colony in Thrace. Among Asiatico-Ionian colonies were\n\n    Abdera, founded by Teos, and Maroneia, celebrated for its wine,\n\n    founded by Chios about 540 B.C.--Kiepert, \"Man. Anct. Geog.\" viii.\n\n    182.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (2) Notably Alcibiades, who possessed two or three such fortresses.\n\n<br/><br/>\nAs soon as the company, consisting of the most powerful Thracians       21\n\nthere present, with the generals and captains of the Hellenes, and any\n\nembassy from a state which might be there, had arrived, they were\n\nseated in a circle, and the dinner was served. Thereupon three-legged\n\nstools were brought in and placed in front of the assembled guests.\n\nThey were laden with pieces of meat, piled up, and there were huge\n\nleavened-loaves fastened on to the pieces of meat with long skewers.\n\nThe tables, as a rule, were set beside the guests at intervals. That\n\nwas the custom; and Seuthes set the fashion of the performance. He\n\ntook up the loaves which lay by his side and broke them into little\n\npieces, and then threw the fragments here to one and there to another\n\nas seemed to him good; and so with the meat likewise, leaving for\n\nhimself the merest taste. Then the rest fell to following the fashion\n\nset them, those that is who had tables placed beside them.\n\n<br/><br/>\nNow there was an Arcadian, Arystas by name, a huge eater; he soon got\n", "tired of throwing the pieces about, and seized a good three-quarters\n\nloaf in his two hands, placed some pieces of meat upon his knees, and\n\nproceeded to discuss his dinner. Then beakers of wine were brought\n\nround, and every one partook in turn; but when the cupbearer came to\n\nArystas and handed him the bowl, he looked up, and seeing that\n\nXenophon had done eating: \"Give it him,\" quoth he, \"he is more at\n\nleisure. I have something better to do at present.\" Seuthes, hearing a\n\nremark, asked the cupbearer what was said, and the cupbearer, who knew\n\nhow to talk Greek, explained. Then followed a peal of laughter.\n\n<br/><br/>\nWhen the drinking had advanced somewhat, in came a Thracian with a\n\nwhite horse, who snatched the brimming bowl and said: \"Here's a health\n\nto thee, O Seuthes! Let me present thee with this horse. Mounted on\n\nhim, thou shalt capture whom thou choosest to pursue, or retiring from\n\nbattle, thou shalt not dread the foe.\" He was followed by one who\n\nbrought in a boy, and presented him in proper style with \"Here's a\n\nhealth to thee, O Seuthes!\" A third had \"clothes for his wife.\"\n\nTimasion, the Dardanian, pledged Seuthes, and presented a silver\n\nbowl (3) and a carpet worth ten minae. Gnesippus, an Athenian, got up    28\n\nand said: \"It was a good old custom, and a fine one too, that those\n\nwho had, should give to the king for honour's sake, but to those who\n\nhad not, the king should give; whereby, my lord,\" he added, \"I too may\n\none day have the wherewithal to give thee gifts and honour.\" Xenophon\n\nthe while was racking his brains what he was to do; he was not the\n\nhappier because he was seated in the seat next Seuthes as a mark of\n\nhonour; and Heracleides bade the cupbearer hand him the bowl. The wine\n\nhad perhaps a little mounted to his head; he rose, and manfully seized\n\nthe cup, and spoke: \"I also, Seuthes, have to present you with myself\n\nand these my dear comrades to be your trusty friends, and not one of\n\nthem against his will. They are more ready, one and all, still more\n", "than I, to be your friends. Here they are; they ask nothing from you\n\nin return, rather they are forward to labour in your behalf; it will\n\nbe their pleasure to bear the brunt of battle in voluntary service.\n\nWith them, God willing, you will gain vast territory; you will recover\n\nwhat was once your forefathers'; you will win for yourself new lands;\n\nand not lands only, but horses many, and of men a multitude, and many\n\na fair dame besides. You will not need to seize upon them in robber\n\nfashion; it is your friends here who, of their own accord, shall take\n\nand bring them to you, they shall lay them at your feet as gifts.\" Up\n\ngot Seuthes and drained with him the cup, and with him sprinkled the\n\nlast drops fraternally (4).\n\n<br/><br/>\n (3) Or rather \"saucer\" ({phiale}).\n\n<br/><br/>\n (4) For the Thracian custom, vide Suidas, s.v. {kataskedazein}.\n\n<br/><br/>\nAt this stage entered musicians blowing upon horns such as they use\n\nfor signal calls, and trumpeting on trumpets, made of raw oxhide,\n\ntunes and airs, like the music of the double-octave harp (5). Seuthes\n\nhimself got up and shouted, trolling forth a war song; then he sprang\n\nfrom his place and leapt about as though he would guard himself\n\nagainst a missile, in right nimble style. Then came in a set of clowns\n\nand jesters.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (5) Or, \"magadis.\" This is said to have been one of the most perfect\n\n    instruments. It comprised two full octaves, the left hand playing\n\n    the same notes as the right an octave lower. Guhl and Koner, p.\n\n    203, Engl. transl. See also \"Dict. Antiq.\" \"Musica\"; and Arist.\n\n    \"Polit.\" xix. 18, {Dia ti e dia pason sumphonia adetai mone;\n\n    magasizousi gar tauten, allen de oudemian}, i.e. \"since no\n", "    interval except the octave ({dia pason}) could be 'magidised' (the\n\n    effect of any other is well known to be intolerable), therefore no\n\n    other interval was employed at all.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nBut when the sun began to set, the Hellenes rose from their seats. It   33\n\nwas time, they said, to place the night sentinels and to pass the\n\nwatchword; further, they begged of Seuthes to issue an order that none\n\nof the Thracians were to enter the Hellenic camp at night, \"since\n\nbetween your Thracian foes and our Thracian friends there might be\n\nsome confusion.\" As they sallied forth, Seuthes rose to accompany\n\nthem, like the soberest of men. When they were outside, he summoned\n\nthe generals apart and said: \"Sirs, our enemies are not aware as yet\n\nof our alliance. If, therefore, we attack them before they take\n\nprecautions not to be caught, or are prepared to repel assault, we\n\nshall make a fine haul of captives and other stock.\" The generals\n\nfully approved of these views, and bade him lead on. He answered:\n\n\"Prepare and wait; as soon as the right time comes I will be with you.\n\nI shall pick up the peltasts and yourselves, and with the help of the\n\ngods, I will lead on.\" \"But consider one point,\" urged Xenophon; \"if\n\nwe are to march by night, is not the Hellenic fashion best? When\n\nmarching in the daytime that part of the army leads the van which\n\nseems best suited to the nature of the country to be traversed--heavy\n\nor light infantry, or cavalry; but by night our rule is that the\n\nslowest arm should take the lead. Thus we avoid the risk of being\n\npulled to pieces: and it is not so easy for a man to give his\n\nneighbour the slip without intending, whereas the scattered fragments\n\nof an army are apt to fall foul of one another, and to cause damage or\n\nincur it in sheer ignorance.\" To this Seuthes replied: \"You reason\n\nwell, and I will adopt your custom. I will furnish you with guides\n\nchosen from the oldest experts of the country, and I will myself\n", "follow with the cavalry in the rear; it will not take me long, if need\n\nbe, to present myself at the front.\" Then, for kinship's sake, they\n\nchose \"Athenaia (6)\" as their watchword. With this, they turned and\n\nsought repose.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (6) \"Our Lady of Athens.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nIt was about midnight when Seuthes presented himself with his cavalry\n\ntroopers armed with corselets, and his light infantry under arms. As    40\n\nsoon as he had handed over to them the promised guides, the heavy\n\ninfantry took the van, followed by the light troops in the centre,\n\nwhile the cavalry brought up the rear. At daybreak Seuthes rode up to\n\nthe front. He complimented them on their method: so often had he\n\nhimself, while marching by night with a mere handful of men, been\n\nseparated with his cavalry from his infantry. \"But now,\" said he, \"we\n\nfind ourselves at dawn of day all happily together, just as we ought\n\nto be. Do you wait for me here,\" he proceeded, \"and recruit\n\nyourselves. I will take a look round and rejoin you.\" So saying he\n\ntook a certain path over hill and rode off. As soon as he had reached\n\ndeep snow, he looked to see whether there were footprints of human\n\nbeings leading forward or in the opposite direction; and having\n\nsatisfied himself that the road was untrodden, back he came,\n\nexclaiming: \"God willing, sirs, it will be all right; we shall fall on\n\nthe fellows, before they know where they are. I will lead on with the\n\ncavalry; so that if we catch sight of any one, he shall not escape and\n\ngive warning to the enemy. Do you follow, and if you are left behind,\n\nkeep to the trail of the horses. Once on the other side of the\n\nmountains, we shall find ourselves in numerous thriving villages.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nBy the middle of the day he had already gained the top of the pass and\n", "looked down upon the villages below. Back he came riding to the heavy\n\ninfantry and said: \"I will at once send off the cavalry into the plain\n\nbelow, and the peltasts too, to attack the villages. Do you follow\n\nwith what speed you may, so that in case of resistance you may lend us\n\nyour aid.\" Hearing this, Xenophon dismounted, and the other asked:\n\n\"Why do you dismount just when speed is the thing we want?\" The other\n\nanswered: \"But you do not want me alone, I am sure. The hoplites will\n\nrun all the quicker and more cheerily if I lead them on foot.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nThereupon Seuthes went off, and Timasion with him, taking the Hellene\n\nsquadron of something like forty troopers. Then Xenophon passed the\n\norder: the active young fellows up to thirty years of age from the\n\ndifferent companies to the front; and off with these he went himself,\n\nbowling along (7); while Cleanor led the other Hellenes. When they had   46\n\nreached the villages, Seuthes, with about thirty troopers, rode up,\n\nexclaiming: \"Well, Xenophon, this is just what you said! the fellows\n\nare caught, but now look here. My cavalry have gone off unsupported;\n\nthey are scattered in pursuit, one here, one there, and upon my word,\n\nI am more than half afraid the enemy will collect somewhere and do\n\nthem a mischief. Some of us must remain in the villages, for they are\n\nswarming with human beings.\" \"Well then,\" said Xenophon, \"I will seize\n\nthe heights with the men I have with me, and do you bid Cleanor extend\n\nhis line along the level beside the villages.\" When they had done so,\n\nthere were enclosed--of captives for the slave market, one thousand;\n\nof cattle, two thousand; and of other small cattle, ten thousand. For\n\nthe time being they took up quarters there.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (7) {etropkhaze}, a favourite word with our author. Herodotus uses it;\n\n    so does Aristot.; so also Polybius; but the Atticists condemn it,\n\n    except of course in poetry.\n", "<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nIV\n\n<br/><br/>\nBut the next day Seuthes burnt the villages to the ground; he left not  1\n\na single house, being minded to inspire terror in the rest of his\n\nenemies, and to show them what they also were to expect, if they\n\nrefused obedience; and so he went back again. As to the booty, he sent\n\noff Heracliedes to Perinthus to dispose of it, with a view to future\n\npay for the soldiers. But for himself he encamped with the Hellenes in\n\nthe lowland country of the Thynians, the natives leaving the flats and\n\nbetaking themselves in flight to the uplands.\n\n<br/><br/>\nThere was deep snow, and cold so intense that the water brought in for\n\ndinner and the wine within the jars froze; and many of the Hellenes\n\nhad their noses and ears frost-bitten. Now they came to understand why\n\nthe Thracians wear fox-skin caps on their heads and about their ears;\n\nand why, on the same principle, they are frocked not only about the\n\nchest and bust but so as to cover the loins and thighs as well; and\n\nwhy on horseback they envelop themselves in long shawls which reach\n\ndown to the feet, instead of the ordinary short rider's cloak. Seuthes\n\nsent off some of the prisoners to the hills with a message to say that\n\nif they did not come down to their homes, and live quietly and obey\n\nhim, he would burn down their villages and their corn, and leave them   5\n\nto perish with hunger. Thereupon down they came, women and children\n\nand the older men; the younger men preferred to quarter themselves in\n\nthe villages on the skirts of the hills. On discovering this, Seuthes\n\nbade Xenophon take the youngest of the heavy infantry and join him on\n", "an expedition. They rose in the night, and by daybreak had reached the\n\nvillages; but the majority of the inhabitants made good their escape,\n\nfor the hills were close at hand. Those whom he did catch, Seuthes\n\nunsparingly shot down.\n\n<br/><br/>\nNow there was a certain Olynthian, named Episthenes; he was a great\n\nlover of boys, and seeing a handsome lad, just in the bloom of youth,\n\nand carrying a light shield, about to be slain, he ran up to Xenophon\n\nand supplicated him to rescue the fair youth. Xenophon went to Seuthes\n\nand begged him not to put the boy to death. He explained to him the\n\ndisposition of Episthenes; how he had once enrolled a company, the\n\nonly qualification required being that of personal beauty; and with\n\nthese handsome young men at his side there were none so brave as he.\n\nSeuthes put the question, \"Would you like to die on his behalf,\n\nEpisthenes?\" whereat the other stretched out his neck, and said,\n\n\"Strike, if the boy bids you, and will thank his preserver.\" Seuthes,\n\nturning to the boy, asked, \"Shall I smite him instead of you?\" The boy\n\nshook his head, imploring him to slay neither the one nor the other,\n\nwhereupon Episthenes caught the lad in his arms, exclaiming, \"It is\n\ntime you did battle with me, Seuthes, for my boy; never will I yield\n\nhim up,\" and Seuthes laughed: \"what must be must,\" and so consented.\n\n<br/><br/>\nIn these villages he decided that they must bivouac, so that the men\n\non the mountains might be still further deprived of subsistence.\n\nStealthily descending he himself found quarters in the plain; while\n\nXenophon with his picked troops encamped in the highest village on the\n\nskirts of the hills,; and the rest of the Hellenes hard by, among the\n\nhighland Thracians (1), as they are called.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) Cf. \"Highlanders.\"\n", "<br/><br/>\nAfter this, not many days had idly slipt away before the Thracians\n\nfrom the mountains came down and wished to arrange with Seuthes for     12\n\nterms of truce and hostages. Simultaneously came Xenophon and informed\n\nSeuthes that they were camped in bad quarters, with the enemy next\n\ndoor; \"it would be pleasanter too,\" he added, \"to bivouac in a strong\n\nposition in the open, than under cover on the edge of destruction.\"\n\nThe other bade him take heart and pointed to some of their hostages,\n\nas much as to say \"Look there!\" Parties also from the mountaineers\n\ncame down and pleaded with Xenophon himself, to help arrange a truce\n\nfor them. This he agreed to do, bidding them to pluck up heart, and\n\nassuring them that they would meet with no mischief, if they yielded\n\nobedience to Seuthes. All their parleying, however, was, as it turned\n\nout, merely to get a closer inspection of things. This happened in the\n\nday, and in the following night the Thynians descended from the hill\n\ncountry and made an attack. In each case, the guide was the master of\n\nthe house attacked; otherwise it would have taxed their powers to\n\ndiscover the houses in the dark, which, for the sake of their flocks\n\nand herds, were palisaded all round with great stockades. As soon as\n\nthey had reached the doors of any particular house, the attack began,\n\nsome hurling in their spears, others belabouring with their clubs,\n\nwhich they carried, it was said, for the purpose of knocking off the\n\nlance points from the shaft. Others were busy setting the place on\n\nfire; and they kept calling Xenophon by name: \"Come out, Xenophon, and\n\ndie like a man, or we will roast you alive inside.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nBy this time too the flames were making their appearance through the\n\nroof, and Xenophon and his followers were within, with their coats of\n\nmail on, and big shields, swords, and helmets. Then Silanus, a\n\nMacistian (2), a youth of some eighteen years, signalled on the\n", "trumpet; and in an instant, out they all leapt with their drawn\n\nswords, and the inmates of other quarters as well. The Thracians took\n\nto their heels, according to their custom, swinging their light\n\nshields round their backs. As they leapt over the stockade some were\n\ncaptured, hanging on the top with their shields caught in the palings;\n\nothers missed the way out, and so were slain; and the Hellenes chased\n\nthem hotly, till they were outside the village.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (2) \"Of Macistus,\" a town in the Triphylia near Scillus.\n\n<br/><br/>\nA party of Thynians turned back, and as the men ran past in bold        18\n\nrelief against a blazing house, they let fly a volley of javelins, out\n\nof the darkness into the glare, and wounded two captains, Hieronymus,\n\nan Euodean (3), and Theogenes, a Locrian. No one was killed, only the\n\nclothes and baggage of some of the men were consumed in the flames.\n\nPresently up came Seuthes to the rescue with seven troopers, the first\n\nto hand, and his Thracian trumpeteer by his side. Seeing that\n\nsomething had happened, he hastened to the rescue, and ever the while\n\nhis bugler wound his horn, which music added terror to the foe.\n\nArrived at length, he greeted them with outstretched hand, exclaiming,\n\n\"I thought to find you all dead men.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\n (3) If this is the same man as Hieronymus of Elis, who has been\n\n    mentioned two or three times already, possibly the word {Euodea}\n\n    points to some town or district of Elis; or perhaps the text is\n\n    corrupt.\n\n<br/><br/>\nAfter that, Xenophon begged him to hand over the hostages to himself,\n\nand if so disposed, to join him on an expedition to the hills, or if\n\nnot, to let him go alone. Accordingly the next day Seuthes delivered\n", "up the hostages. They were men already advanced in years, but the pick\n\nof the mountaineers, as they themselves gave out. Not merely did\n\nSeuthes do this, but he came himself, with his force at his back (and\n\nby this time he had treble his former force, for many of the\n\nOdrysians, hearing of his proceedings, came down to join in the\n\ncampaign); and the Thynians, espying from the mountains the vast array\n\nof heavy infantry and light infantry and cavalry, rank upon rank, came\n\ndown and supplicated him to make terms. \"They were ready,\" they\n\nprofessed, \"to do all that he demanded; let him take pledges of their\n\ngood faith.\" So Seuthes summoned Xenophon and explained their\n\nproposals, adding that he should make no terms with them, if Xenophon\n\nwished to punish them for their night attack. The latter replied: \"For\n\nmy part, I should think their punishment is great enough already, if\n\nthey are to be slaves instead of free men; still,\" he added, \"I advise\n\nyou for the future to take as hostages those who are most capable of\n\ndoing mischief, and to let the old men abide in peace at home.\" So to\n\na man they gave in their adhesion in that quarter of the country.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nV\n\n<br/><br/>\nCrossing over in the direction of the Thracians above Byzantium, they   1\n\nreached the Delta, as it is called. Here they were no longer in the\n\nterritory of the Maesades, but in the country of Teres the Odrysian\n\n (an ancient worthy (1)). Here Heracleides met them with the proceeds of\n\nthe spoil, and Seuthes picked out three pairs of mules (there were\n\nonly three, the other teams being oxen); then he summoned Xenophon and\n\nbade him take them, and divide the rest between the generals and\n", "officers, to which Xenophon replied that for himself, he was content\n\nto receive his share another time, but added: \"Make a present of these\n\nto my friends here, the generals who have served with me, and to the\n\nofficers.\" So of the pairs of mules Timasion the Dardanian received\n\none, Cleanor the Orchomenian one, and Phryniscus the Achaean one. The\n\nteams of oxen were divided among the officers. Then Seuthes proceeded\n\nto remit pay due for the month already passed, but all he could give\n\nwas the equivalent of twenty days. Heracleides insisted that this was\n\nall he had got by his trafficking. Whereupon Xenophon with some warmth\n\nexclaimed: \"Upon my word, Heracleides, I do not think you care for\n\nSeuthes' interest as you should. If you did, you have been at pains to\n\nbring back the full amount of the pay, even if you had had to raise a\n\nloan to do so, and, if by no other means, by selling the coat off your\n\nown back.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) See above re previous Teres. The words \"an ancient worthy\" may\n\n    possibly be an editor's or commentator's note.\n\n<br/><br/>\nWhat he said annoyed Heracleides, who was afraid of being ousted from\n\nthe friendship of Seuthes, and from that day forward he did his best\n\nto calumniate Xenophon before Seuthes. The soldiers, on their side,\n\nlaid the blame of course on Xenophon: \"Where was their pay?\" and\n\nSeuthes was vexed with him for persistently demanding it for them. Up\n\nto this date he had frequently referred to what he would do when he\n\ngot to the seaboard again; how he intended to hand over to him\n\nBisanthe, Ganos, and Neontichos (2). But from this time forward he\n\nnever mentioned one of them again. The slanderous tongue of\n\nHeracleides had whispered him:--it was not safe to hand over fortified  8\n\ntowns to a man with a force at his back.\n\n<br/><br/>", " (2) For Bisanthe see above. Ganos, a little lower down the coast, with\n\n    Neontichos once belonged to Alcibiades, if we may believe\n\n    Cornelius Nepos, \"Alc.\" vii. 4, and Plutarch, \"Alc.\" c. 36. See\n\n    above.\n\n<br/><br/>\nConsequently Xenophon fell to considering what he ought to do as\n\nregards marching any further up the country; and Heracleides\n\nintroduced the other generals to Seuthes, urging them to say that they\n\nwere quite as well able to lead the army as Xenophon, and promising\n\nthem that within a day or two they should have full pay for two\n\nmonths, and he again implored them to continue the campaign with\n\nSeuthes. To which Timasion replied that for his part he would continue\n\nno campaign without Xenophon; not even if they were to give him pay\n\nfor five months; and what Timasion said, Phryniscus and Cleanor\n\nrepeated; the views of all three coincided.\n\n<br/><br/>\nSeuthes fell to upbraiding Heracleides in round terms. \"Why had he not\n\ninvited Xenophon with the others?\" and presently they invited him, but\n\nby himself alone. He, perceiving the knavery of Heracleides, and that\n\nhis object was to calumniate him with the other generals, presented\n\nhimself; but at the same time he took care to bring all the generals\n\nand the officers. After their joint consent had been secured, they\n\ncontinued the campaign. Keeping the Pontus on their right, they passed\n\nthrough the millet-eating (3) Thracians, as they are called, and\n\nreached Salmydessus. This is a point at which many trading vessels\n\nbound for the Black Sea run aground and are wrecked, owing to a sort\n\nof marshy ledge or sandbank which runs out for a considerable distance\n\ninto the sea (4). The Thracians, who dwell in these parts, have set up\n\npillars as boundary marks, and each set of them has the pillage of its\n\nown flotsom and jetsom; for in old days, before they set up these\n", "landmarks, the wreckers, it is said, used freely to fall foul of and\n\nslay one another. Here was a rich treasure trove, of beds and boxes     14\n\nnumberless, with a mass of written books, and all the various things\n\nwhich mariners carry in their wooden chests. Having reduced this\n\ndistrict, they turned round and went back again. By this time the army\n\nof Seuthes had grown to be considerably larger than the Hellenic army;\n\nfor on the one hand, the Odrysians flocked down in still larger\n\nnumbers, and on the other, the tribes which gave in their adhesion\n\nfrom time to time were amalgamated with his armament. They got into\n\nquarters on the flat country above Selybria at about three miles (5)\n\ndistance from the sea. As to pay, not a penny was as yet forthcoming,\n\nand the soldiers were cruelly disaffected to Xenophon, whilst Seuthes,\n\non his side, was no longer so friendlily disposed. If Xenophon ever\n\nwished to come face to face with him, want of leisure or some other\n\ndifficulty always seemed to present itself.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (3) Or, \"the Melinophagi.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\n (4) See, for a description of this savage coast, Aesch. \"Prom.\" vinc.\n\n    726, etc.--\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"{trakheia pontou Salmudesia gnathos\n\nekhthroxenos nautaisi, metruia neon.}\"\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"The rugged Salmudesian jaw of the Black Sea,\n\nInhospitable to sailors, stepmother of ships.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nBut the poet is at fault in his geography, since he connects \"the\n\nSalmydesian jaw\" with the Thermodon.\n\n<br/><br/>", " (5) Lit. \"thirty stades.\" Selybria is about fourty-four miles from\n\n    Byzantium, two-thirds of the way to Perinthus.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nVI\n\n<br/><br/>\nAt this date, when nearly two months had already passed, an embassy     1\n\narrived. These were two agents from Thibron--Charminus, a\n\nLacedaemonian, and Polynicus. They were sent to say that the\n\nLacedaemonians had resolved to open a campaign against Tissaphernes,\n\nand that Thibron, who had set sail to conduct the war, was anxious to\n\navail himself of the troops. He could guarantee that each soldier\n\nshould receive a daric a month as pay, the officers double pay, and\n\nthe generals quadruple. The Lacedaemonian emissaries had no sooner\n\narrived than Heracleides, having learnt that they had come in search\n\nof the Hellenic troops, goes off himself to Seuthes and says: \"The\n\nbest thing that could have happened; the Lacedaemonians want these\n\ntroops and you have done with them, so that if you hand over the\n\ntroops to them, you will do the Lacedaemonians a good turn and will\n\ncease to be bothered for pay any more. The country will be quit of\n\nthem once and for ever.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nOn hearing this Seuthes bade him introduce the emissaries. As soon as\n\nthey had stated that the object of their coming was to treat for the\n\nHellenic troops, he replied that he would willingly give them up, that\n\nhis one desire was to be the friend and ally of Lacedaemon. So he\n\ninvited them to partake of hospitality, and entertained them            3\n\nmagnificently; but he did not invite Xenophon, nor indeed any of the\n", "other generals. Presently the Lacedaemonians asked: \"What sort of man\n\nis Xenophon?\" and Seuthes answered: \"Not a bad fellow in most\n\nrespects; but he is too much the soldiers' friend; and that is why it\n\ngoes ill with him.\" They asked: \"Does he play the popular leader?\" and\n\nHeracleides answered: \"Exactly so.\" \"Well then,\" said they, \"he will\n\noppose our taking away the troops, will he not?\" \"To be sure he will,\"\n\nsaid Heracleides; \"but you have only to call a meeting of the whole\n\nbody, and promise them pay, and little further heed will they pay to\n\nhim; they will run off with you.\" \"How then are we to get them\n\ncollected?\" they asked. \"Early to-morrow,\" said Heracleides, \"we will\n\nbring you to them; and I know,\" he added once more, \"as soon as they\n\nset eyes on you, they will flock to you with alacrity.\" Thus the day\n\nended.\n\n<br/><br/>\nThe next day Seuthes and Heracleides brought the two Laconian agents\n\nto the army, and the troops were collected, and the agents made a\n\nstatement as follows: \"The Lacedaemonians have resolved on war with\n\nTissaphernes, who did you so much wrong. By going with us therefore\n\nyou will punish your enemy, and each of you will get a daric a month,\n\nthe officers twice that sum, and the generals quadruple.\" The soldiers\n\nlent willing ears, and up jumped one of the Arcadians at once, to find\n\nfault with Xenophon. Seuthes also was hard by, wishing to know what\n\nwas going to happen. He stood within ear shot, and his interpreter by\n\nhis side; not but what he could understand most of what was said in\n\nGreek himself. At this point the Arcadian spoke: \"For the matter of\n\nthat, Lacedaemonians, we should have been by your sides long ago, if\n\nXenophon had not persuaded us and brought us hither. We have never\n\nceased campaigning, night and day, the dismal winter through, but he\n\nreaps the fruit of our toils. Seuthes has enriched him privately, but\n\ndeprives us of our honest earnings; so that, standing here as I do to\n", "address you first, all I can say is, that if I might see the fellow\n\nstoned to death as a penalty for all the long dance he has led us, I    10\n\nshould feel I had got my pay in full, and no longer grudge the pains\n\nwe have undergone.\" The speaker was followed by another and then\n\nanother in the same strain; and after that Xenophon made the following\n\nspeech:--\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"True is the old adage; there is nothing which mortal man may not\n\nexpect to see. Here am I being accused by you to-day, just where my\n\nconscience tells me that I have displayed the greatest zeal on your\n\nbehalf. Was I not actually on my road home when I turned back? Not,\n\nGod knows, because I learned that you were in luck's way, but because\n\nI heard that you were in sore straits, and I wished to help you, if in\n\nany way I could. I returned, and Seuthes yonder sent me messenger\n\nafter messenger, and made me promise upon promise, if only I could\n\npersuade you to come to him. Yet, as you yourselves will bear me\n\nwitness, I was not to be diverted. Instead of setting my hand to do\n\nthat, I simply led you to a point from which, with least loss of time,\n\nI thought you could cross into Asia. This I believed was the best\n\nthing for you, and you I knew desired it.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"But when Aristarchus came with his ships of war and hindered our\n\npassage across, you will hardly quarrel with me for the step I then\n\ntook in calling you together that we might advisedly consider our best\n\ncourse. Having heard both sides--first Aristarchus, who ordered you to\n\nmarch to the Chersonese, then Seuthes, who pleaded with you to\n\nundertake a campaign with himself--you all proposed to go with\n\nSeuthes; and you all gave your votes to that effect. What wrong did I\n\ncommit in bringing you, whither you were eager to go? If, indeed,\n\nsince the time when Seuthes began to tell lies and cheat us about the\n", "pay, I have supported him in this, you may justly find fault with me\n\nand hate me. But if I, who at first was most of all his friend, to-day\n\nam more than any one else at variance with him, how can I, who have\n\nchosen you and rejected Seuthes, in fairness be blamed by you for the\n\nvery thing which has been the ground of quarrel between him and me?\n\nBut you will tell me, perhaps, that I get from Seuthes what is by\n\nright yours, and that I deal subtly by you? But is it not clear that,\n\nif Seuthes has paid me anything, he has at any rate not done so with    16\n\nthe intention of losing by what he gives me, whilst he is still your\n\ndebtor? If he gave to me, he gave in order that, by a small gift to\n\nme, he might escape a larger payment to yourselves. But if that is\n\nwhat you really think has happened, you can render this whole scheme\n\nof ours null and void in an instant by exacting from him the money\n\nwhich is your due. It is clear, Seuthes will demand back from me\n\nwhatever I have got from him, and he will have all the more right to\n\ndo so, if I have failed to secure for him what he bargained for when I\n\ntook his gifts. But indeed, I am far removed from enjoying what is\n\nyours, and I swear to you by all the gods and goddesses that I have\n\nnot taken even what Seuthes promised me in private. He is present\n\nhimself and listening, and he is aware in his own heart whether I\n\nswear falsely. And what will surprise you the more, I can swear\n\nbesides, that I have not received even what the other generals have\n\nreceived, no, nor yet what some of the officers have received. But how\n\nso? why have I managed my affairs no better? I thought, sirs, the more\n\nI helped him to bear his poverty at the time, the more I should make\n\nhim my friend in the day of his power. Whereas, it is just when I see\n\nthe star of his good fortune rising, that I have come to divine the\n\nsecret of his character.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"Some one may say, are you not ashamed to be so taken in like a fool?\n", "Yes, I should be ashamed, if it had been an open enemy who had so\n\ndeceived me. But, to my mind, when friend cheats friend, a deeper\n\nstain attaches to the perpetrator than to the victim of deceit.\n\nWhatever precaution a man may take against his friend, that we took in\n\nfull. We certainly gave him no pretext for refusing to pay us what he\n\npromised. We were perfectly upright in our dealings with him. We did\n\nnot dawdle over his affairs, nor did we shrink from any work to which\n\nhe challenged us.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"But you will say, I ought to have taken security of him at the time,\n\nso that had he fostered the wish, he might have lacked the ability to\n\ndeceive. To meet that retort, I must beg you to listen to certain\n\nthings, which I should never have said in his presence, except for\n\nyour utter want of feeling towards me, or your extraordinary\n\ningratitude. Try and recall the posture of your affairs, when I         24\n\nextricated you and brought you to Seuthes. Do you not recollect how at\n\nPerinthus Aristarchus shut the gates in your faces each time you\n\noffered to approach the town, and how you were driven to camp outside\n\nunder the canopy of heaven? It was midwinter; you were thrown upon the\n\nresources of a market wherein few were the articles offered for sale,\n\nand scanty the wherewithal to purchase them. Yet stay in Thrace you\n\nmust, for there were ships of war riding at anchor in the bay, ready\n\nto hinder your passage across; and what did that stay imply? It meant\n\nbeing in a hostile country, confronted by countless cavalry, legions\n\nof light infantry. And what had we? A heavy infantry force certainly,\n\nwith which we could have dashed at villages in a body possibly, and\n\nseized a modicum of food at most; but as to pursuing the enemy with\n\nsuch a force as ours, or capturing men or cattle, the thing was out of\n\nthe question; for when I rejoined you your original cavalry and light\n\ninfantry divisions had disappeared. In such sore straits you lay!\n", "<br/><br/>\n\"Supposing that, without making any demands for pay whatever, I had\n\nmerely won for you the alliance of Seuthes--whose cavalry and light\n\ninfantry were just what you needed--would you not have thought that I\n\nhad planned very well for you? I presume, it was through your\n\npartnership with him and his that you were able to find such complete\n\nstores of corn in the villages, when the Thracians were driven to take\n\nto their heels in such hot haste, and you had so large a share of\n\ncaptives and cattle. Why! from the day on which his cavalry force was\n\nattached to us, we never set eyes on a single foeman in the field,\n\nthough up to that date the enemy with his cavalry and his light\n\ninfantry used undauntedly to hang on our heels, and effectually\n\nprevented us from scattering in small bodies and reaping a rich\n\nharvest of provisions. But if he who partly gave you this security has\n\nfailed to pay in full the wages due to you therefrom, is not that a\n\nterrible misfortune? So monstrous indeed that you think I ought not to\n\ngo forth alive (1).\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) I.e. the fate of a scape-goat is too good for me.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"But let me ask you, in what condition do you turn your backs on this   31\n\nland to-day? Have you not wintered here in the lap of plenty? Whatever\n\nyou have got from Seuthes has been surplus gain. Your enemies have had\n\nto meet the bill of your expenses, whilst you led a merry round of\n\nexistence, in which you have not once set eyes on the dead body of a\n\ncomrade or lost one living man. Again, if you have achieved any, (or\n\nrather many) noble deeds against the Asiatic barbarian, you have them\n\nsafe. And in addition to these to-day you have won for yourselves a\n\nsecond glory. You undertook a campaign against the European Thracians,\n\nand have mastered them. What I say then is, that these very matters\n", "which you make a ground of quarrel against myself, are rather\n\nblessings for which you ought to show gratitude to heaven.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"Thus far I have confined myself to your side of the matter. Bear with\n\nme, I beg you, while we examine mine. When I first essayed to part\n\nwith you and journey homewards, I was doubly blest. From your lips I\n\nhad won some praise, and, thanks to you, I had obtained glory from the\n\nrest of Hellas. I was trusted by the Lacedaemonians; else would they\n\nnot have sent me back to you. Whereas to-day I turn to go, calumniated\n\nbefore the Lacedaemonians by yourselves, detested in your behalf by\n\nSeuthes, whom I meant so to benefit, by help of you, that I should\n\nfind in him a refuge for myself and for my children, if children I\n\nmight have, in after time. And you the while, for whose sake I have\n\nincurred so much hate, the hate of people far superior to me in\n\nstrength, you, for whom I have not yet ceased to devise all the good I\n\ncan, entertain such sentiments about me. Why? I am no renegade or\n\nrunaway slave, you have got hold of. If you carry out what you say, be\n\nsure you will have done to death a man who has passed many a vigil in\n\nwatching over you; who has shared with you many a toil and run many a\n\nrisk in turn and out of turn; who, thanks to the gracious gods! has by\n\nyour side set up full many a trophy over the barbarian; who, lastly,\n\nhas strained every nerve in his body to protect you against\n\nyourselves. And so it is, that to-day you can move freely, where you\n\nchoose, by sea or by land, and no one can say you nay; and you, on      37\n\nwhom this large liberty dawns, who are sailing to a long desired goal,\n\nwho are sought after by the greatest of military powers, who have pay\n\nin prospect, and for leaders these Lacedaemonians, our acknowledged\n\nchiefs: now is the appointed time, you think, to put me to a speedy\n\ndeath. But in the days of our difficulties it was very different, O ye\n\nmen of marvellous memory! No! in those days you called me 'father!'\n", "and you promised you would bear me ever in mind, 'your benefactor.'\n\nNot so, however, not so ungracious are those who have come to you\n\nto-day; nor, if I mistake not, have you bettered yourselves in their\n\neyes by your treatment of me.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nWith these words he paused, and Charminus the Lacedaemonian got up and\n\nsaid: \"Nay, by the Twins, you are wrong, surely, in your anger against\n\nthis man; I myself can bear testimony in his favour. When Polynicus\n\nand I asked Seuthes, what sort of a man he was? Seuthes answered:--he\n\nhad but one fault to find with him, that he was too much the soldiers'\n\nfriend, which also was the cause why things went wrong with him,\n\nwhether as regards us Lacedaemonians or himself, Seuthes.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nUpon that Eurylochus of Lusia, an Arcadian, got up and said\n\n(addressing the two Lacedaemonians), \"Yes, sirs; and what strikes me\n\nis that you cannot begin your generalship of us better than by\n\nexacting from Seuthes our pay. Whether he like it or no, let him pay\n\nin full; and do not take us away before.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nPolycrates the Athenian, who was put forward by Xenophon, said: \"If my\n\neyes do not deceive me, sirs, there stands Heracleides, yonder, the\n\nman who received the property won by our toil, who took and sold it,\n\nand never gave back either to Seuthes or to us the proceeds of the\n\nsale, but kept the money to himself, like the thief he is. If we are\n\nwise, we will lay hold of him, for he is no Thracian, but a Hellene;\n\nand against Hellenes is the wrong he has committed.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nWhen Heracleides heard these words, he was in great consternation; so\n\nhe came to Seuthes and said: \"If we are wise we will get away from\n\nhere out of reach of these fellows.\" So they mounted their horses and\n", "were gone in a trice, galloping to their own camp. Subsequently         42\n\nSeuthes sent Abrozelmes, his private interpreter, to Xenophon, begging\n\nhim to stay behind with one thousand heavy troops; and engaging duly\n\nto deliver to him the places on the seaboard, and the other things\n\nwhich he had promised; and then, as a great secret, he told him, that\n\nhe had heard from Polynicus that if he once got into the clutches of\n\nthe Lacedaemonians, Thibron was certain to put him to death. Similar\n\nmessages kept coming to Xenophon by letter or otherwise from several\n\nquarters, warning him that he was calumniated, and had best be on his\n\nguard. Hearing which, he took two victims and sacrificed to Zeus the\n\nKing: \"Whether it were better and happier to stay with Seuthes on the\n\nterms proposed, or depart with the army?\" The answer he received was,\n\n\"Depart.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nVII\n\n<br/><br/>\nAfter this, Seuthes removed his camp to some considerable distance;     1\n\nand the Hellenes took up their quarters in some villages, selecting\n\nthose in which they could best supply their commissariat, on the road\n\nto the sea. Now these particular villages had been given by Seuthes to\n\nMedosades. Accordingly, when the latter saw his property in the\n\nvillages being expended by the Hellenes, he was not over well pleased;\n\nand taking with him an Odrysian, a powerful person amongst those who\n\nhad come down from the interior, and about thirty mounted troopers, he\n\ncame and challenged Xenophon to come forth from the Hellenic host. He,\n\ntaking some of the officers and others of a character to be relied\n\nupon, came forward. Then Medosades, addressing Xenophon, said: \"You\n", "are doing wrong to pillage our villages; we give you fair warning--I,\n\nin behalf of Seuthes, and this man by my side, who comes from Medocus,\n\nthe king up country--to begone out of the land. If you refuse,\n\nunderstand, we have no notion of handing it over to you; but if you\n\ninjure our country we will retaliate upon you as foes.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nXenophon, hearing what they had to say, replied: \"Such language\n\naddressed to us by you, of all people, is hard to answer. Yet for the\n\nsake of the young man with you, I will attempt to do so, that at least\n\nhe may learn how different your nature is from ours. We,\" he\n\ncontinued, \"before we were your friends, had the free run of this\n\ncountry, moving this way or that, as it took our fancy, pillaging and   5\n\nburning just as we chose; and you yourself, Medosades, whenever you\n\ncame to us on an embassy, camped with us, without apprehension of any\n\nfoe. As a tribe collectively you scarcely approached the country at\n\nall, or if you found yourselves in it, you bivouacked with your horses\n\nbitted and bridled, as being in the territory of your superiors.\n\nPresently you made friends with us, and, thanks to us, by God's help\n\nyou have won this country, out of which to-day you seek to drive us; a\n\ncountry which we held by our own strength and gave to you. No hostile\n\nforce, as you well know, was capable of expelling us. It might have\n\nbeen expected of you personally to speed us on our way with some gift,\n\nin return for the good we did you. Not so; even though our backs are\n\nturned to go, we are too slow in our movements for you. You will not\n\nsuffer us to take up quarters even, if you can help it, and these\n\nwords arouse no shame in you, either before the gods, or this\n\nOdrysian, in whose eyes to-day you are man of means, though until you\n\ncultivated our friendship you lived a robber's life, as you have told\n\nus. However, why do you address yourself to me? I am no longer in\n\ncommand. Our generals are the Lacedaemonians, to whom you and yours\n", "delivered the army for withdrawal; and that, without even inviting me\n\nto attend, you most marvellous of men, so that if I lost their favour\n\nwhen I brought you the troops, I might now win their gratitude by\n\nrestoring them.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nAs soon as the Odrysian had heard this statement, he exclaimed: \"For\n\nmy part, Medosades, I sink under the earth for very shame at what I\n\nhear. If I had known the truth before, I would never have accompanied\n\nyou. As it is, I return at once. Never would King Medocus applaud me,\n\nif I drove forth his benefactors.\" With these words, he mounted his\n\nhorse and rode away, and with him the rest of his horsemen, except\n\nfour or five. But Medosades, still vexed by the pillaging of the\n\ncountry, urged Xenophon to summon the two Lacedaemonians; and he,\n\ntaking the pick of his men, came to Charminus and Polynicus and\n\ninformed them that they were summoned by Medosades; probably they,\n\nlike himself, would be warned to leave the country; \"if so,\" he added,  14\n\n\"you will be able to recover the pay which is owing to the army. You\n\ncan say to them, that the army has requested you to assist in exacting\n\ntheir pay from Seuthes, whether he like it or not; that they have\n\npromised, as soon as they get this, cheerfully to follow you; that the\n\ndemand seems to you to be only just, and that you have accordingly\n\npromised not to leave, until the soldiers have got their dues.\" The\n\nLacedaemonians accepted the suggestion: they would apply these\n\narguments and others the most forcible they could hit upon; and with\n\nthe proper representatives of the army, they immediately set off.\n\n<br/><br/>\nOn their arrival Charminus spoke: \"If you have anything to say to us,\n\nMedosades, say it; but if not, we have something to say to you.\" And\n\nMedosades submissively made answer: \"I say,\" said he, \"and Seuthes\n\nsays the same: we think we have a right to ask that those who have\n", "become our friends should not be ill-treated by you; whatever ill you\n\ndo to them you really do to us, for they are a part of us.\" \"Good!\"\n\nreplied the Lacedaemonians, \"and we intend to go away as soon as those\n\nwho won for you the people and the territory in question have got\n\ntheir pay. Failing that, we are coming without further delay to assist\n\nthem and to punish certain others who have broken their oaths and done\n\nthem wrong. If it should turn out that you come under this head, when\n\nwe come to exact justice, we shall begin with you.\" Xenophon added:\n\n\"Would you prefer, Medosades, to leave it to these people themselves,\n\nin whose country we are (your friends, since this is the designation\n\nyou prefer), to decide by ballot, which of the two should leave the\n\ncountry, you or we?\" To that proposal he shook his head, but he\n\ntrusted the two Laconians might be induced to go to Seuthes about the\n\npay, adding, \"Seuthes, I am sure, will lend a willing ear;\" or if they\n\ncould not go, then he prayed them to send Xenophon with himself,\n\npromising to lend the latter all the aid in his power, and finally he\n\nbegged them not to burn the villages. Accordingly they sent Xenophon,\n\nand with him a serviceable staff. Being arrived, he addressed Seuthes\n\nthus:--\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"Seuthes, I am here to advance no claims, but to show you, if I can,    21\n\nhow unjust it was on your part to be angered with me because I\n\nzealously demanded of you on behalf of the soldiers what you promised\n\nthem. According to my belief, it was no less to your interest to\n\ndeliver it up, than it was to theirs to receive it. I cannot forget\n\nthat, next to the gods, it was they who raised you up to a conspicuous\n\neminence, when they made you king of large territory and many men, a\n\nposition in which you cannot escape notice, whether you do good or do\n\nevil. For a man so circumstanced, I regarded it as a great thing that\n\nhe should avoid the suspicion even of ungrateful parting with his\n", "benefactors. It was a great thing, I thought, that you should be well\n\nspoken of by six thousand human beings; but the greatest thing of all,\n\nthat you should in no wise discredit the sincerity of your own word.\n\nFor what of the man who cannot be trusted? I see that the words of his\n\nmouth are but vain words, powerless, and unhonoured; but with him who\n\nis seen to regard truth, the case is otherwise. He can achieve by his\n\nwords what another achieves by force. If he seeks to bring the foolish\n\nto their senses--his very frown, I perceive, has a more sobering\n\neffect than the chastisement inflicted by another. Or in negotiations\n\nthe very promises of such an one are of equal weight with the gifts of\n\nanother.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"Try and recall to mind in your own case, what advance of money you\n\nmade to us to purchase our alliance. You know you did not advance one\n\npenny. It was simply confidence in the sincerity of your word which\n\nincited all these men to assist you in your campaign, and so to\n\nacquire for you an empire, worth many times more than thirty talents,\n\nwhich is all they now claim to receive. Here then, first of all, goes\n\nthe credit which won for you your kingdom, sold for so mean a sum. Let\n\nme remind you of the great importance which you then attached to the\n\nacquisition of your present conquests. I am certain that to achieve\n\nwhat stands achieved to-day, you would willingly have foregone the\n\ngain of fifty times that paltry sum. To me it seems that to lose your\n\npresent fortune were a more serious loss than never to have won it;\n\nsince surely it is harder to be poor after being rich than never to     28\n\nhave tasted wealth at all, and more painful to sink to the level of a\n\nsubject, being a king, then never to have worn a crown.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"You cannot forget that your present vassals were not persuaded to\n\nbecome your subjects out of love for you, but by sheer force; and but\n", "for some restraining dread they would endeavour to be free again\n\nto-morrow. And how do you propose to stimulate their sense of awe, and\n\nkeep them in good behaviour towards you? Shall they see our soldiers\n\nso disposed towards you that a word on your part would suffice to keep\n\nthem now, or if necessary would bring them back again to-morrow? while\n\nothers hearing from us a hundred stories in your praise, hasten to\n\npresent themselves at your desire? Or will you drive them to conclude\n\nadversely, that through mistrust of what has happened now, no second\n\nset of soldiers will come to help you, for even these troops of ours\n\nare more their friends than yours? And indeed it was not because they\n\nfell short of us in numbers that they became your subjects, but from\n\nlack of proper leaders. There is a danger, therefore, now lest they\n\nshould choose as their protectors some of us who regard ourselves as\n\nwronged by you, or even better men than us--the Lacedaemonians\n\nthemselves; supposing our soldiers undertake to serve with more\n\nenthusiasm, if the debt you owe to them be first exacted; and the\n\nLacedaemonians, who need their services, consent to this request. It\n\nis plain, at any rate, that the Thracians, now prostrate at your feet,\n\nwould display far more enthusiasm in attacking, than in assisting you;\n\nfor your mastery means their slavery, and your defeat their liberty.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"Again, the country is now yours, and from this time forward you have\n\nto make provision for what is yours; and how will you best secure it\n\nan immunity from ill? Either these soldiers receive their dues and go,\n\nleaving a legacy of peace behind, or they stay and occupy an enemy's\n\ncountry, whilst you endeavour, by aid of a still larger army, to open\n\na new campaign and turn them out; and your new troops will also need\n\nprovisions. Or again, which will be the greater drain on your purse?\n\nto pay off your present debt, or, with that still owing, to bid for\n\nmore troops, and of a better quality?\n", "<br/><br/>\n\"Heracleides, as he used to prove to me, finds the sum excessive. But   35\n\nsurely it is a far less serious thing for you to take and pay it back\n\nto-day than it would have been to pay the tithe of it, before we came\n\nto you; since the limit between less and more is no fixed number, but\n\ndepends on the relative capacity of payer and recipient, and your\n\nyearly income now is larger than the whole property which you\n\npossessed in earlier days.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"Well, Seuthes, for myself these remarks are the expression of\n\nfriendly forethought for a friend. They are expressed in the double\n\nhope that you may show yourself worthy of the good things which the\n\ngods have given you, and that my reputation may not be ruined with the\n\narmy. For I must assure you that to-day, if I wished to injure a foe,\n\nI could not do so with this army. Nor again, if I wished to come and\n\nhelp you, should I be competent to the task; such is the disposition\n\nof the troops towards me. And yet I call you to witness, along with\n\nthe gods who know, that never have I received anything from you on\n\naccount of the soldiers. Never to this day have I, to my private gain,\n\nasked for what was theirs, nor even claimed the promises which were\n\nmade to myself; and I swear to you, not even had you proposed to pay\n\nme my dues, would I have accepted them, unless the soldiers also had\n\nbeen going to receive theirs too; how could I? How shameful it would\n\nhave been in me, so to have secured my own interests, whilst I\n\ndisregarded the disastrous state of theirs, I being so honoured by\n\nthem. Of course to the mind of Heracleides this is all silly talk;\n\nsince the one great object is to keep money by whatever means. That is\n\nnot my tenet, Seuthes. I believe that no fairer or brighter jewel can\n\nbe given to a man, and most of all a prince, than the threefold grace\n\nof valour, justice, and generosity. He that possesses these is rich in\n", "the multitude of friends which surround him; rich also in the desire\n\nof others to be included in their number. While he prospers, he is\n\nsurrounded by those who will rejoice with him in his joy; or if\n\nmisfortune overtake him, he has no lack of sympathisers to give him\n\nhelp. However, if you have failed to learn from my deeds that I was,\n\nheart and soul, your friend; if my words are powerless to reveal the\n\nfact to-day, I would at least direct your attention to what the         43\n\nsoldiers said; you were standing by and heard what those who sought to\n\nblame me said. They accused me to the Lacedaemonians, and the point of\n\ntheir indictment was that I set greater store by yourself than by the\n\nLacedaemonians; but, as regards themselves, the charge was that I took\n\nmore pains to secure the success of your interests than their own.\n\nThey suggested that I had actually taken gifts from you. Was it, do\n\nyou suppose, because they detected some ill-will in me towards you\n\nthat they made the allegation? Was it not rather, that they had\n\nnoticed my abundant zeal on your behalf?\n\n<br/><br/>\n\"All men believe, I think, that a fund of kindly feeling is due to him\n\nfrom whom we accept gifts. But what is your behaviour? Before I had\n\nministered to you in any way, or done you a single service, you\n\nwelcomed me kindly with your eyes, your voice, your hospitality, and\n\nyou could not sate yourself with promises of all the fine things that\n\nwere to follow. But having once achieved your object, and become the\n\ngreat man you now are, as great indeed as I could make you, you can\n\nstand by and see me degraded among my own soldiers! Well, time will\n\nteach you--that I fully believe--to pay whatever seems to you right,\n\nand even without the lessons of that teacher you will hardly care to\n\nsee whose who have spent themselves in benefiting you, become your\n\naccusers. Only, when you do pay your debt, I beg of you to use your\n\nbest endeavour to right me with the soldiers. Leave me at least where\n", "you found me; that is all I ask.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nAfter listening to this appeal, Seuthes called down curses on him,\n\nwhose fault it was, that the debt had not long ago been paid, and, if\n\nthe general suspicion was correct, this was Heracleides. \"For myself,\"\n\nsaid Seuthes, \"I never had any idea of robbing you of your just dues.\n\nI will repay.\" Then Xenophon rejoined: \"Since you are minded to pay, I\n\nonly ask that you will do so through me, and will not suffer me on\n\nyour account to hold a different position in the army from what I held\n\nwhen we joined you.\" He replied: \"As far as that goes, so far from\n\nholding a less honoured position among your own men on my account, if\n\nyou will stay with me, keeping only a thousand heavy infantry, I will\n\ndeliver to you the fortified places and everything I promised.\" The\n\nother answered: \"On these terms I may not accept them, only let us go   51\n\nfree.\" \"Nay, but I know,\" said Seuthes, \"that it is safer for you to\n\nbide with me than to go away.\" Then Xenophon again: \"For your\n\nforethought I thank you, but I may not stay. Somewhere I may rise to\n\nhonour, and that, be sure, shall redound to your gain also.\" Thereupon\n\nSeuthes spoke: \"Of silver I have but little; that little, however, I\n\ngive to you, one talent; but of beeves I can give you six hundred\n\nhead, and of sheep four thousand, and of slaves six score. These take,\n\nand the hostages besides, who wronged you, and begone.\" Xenophon\n\nlaughed and said: \"But supposing these all together do not amount to\n\nthe pay; for whom is the talent, shall I say? It is a little dangerous\n\nfor myself, is it not? I think I had better be on the look-out for\n\nstones when I return. You heard the threats?\"\n\n<br/><br/>\nSo for the moment he stayed there, but the next day Seuthes gave up to\n\nthem what he had promised, and sent an escort to drive the cattle. The\n\nsoldiers at first maintained that Xenophon had gone to take up his\n", "abode with Seuthes, and to receive what he had been promised; so when\n\nthey saw him they were pleased, and ran to meet him. And Xenophon,\n\nseeing Charminus and Polynicus, said: \"Thanks to your intervention,\n\nthis much has been saved for the army. My duty is to deliver this\n\nfraction over to your keeping; do you divide and distribute it to the\n\nsoldiers.\" Accordingly they took the property and appointed official\n\nvendors of the booty, and in the end incurred considerable blame.\n\nXenophon held aloof. In fact it was no secret that he was making his\n\npreparations to return home, for as yet the vote of banishment had not\n\nbeen passed at Athens (1). But the authorities in the camp came to him\n\nand begged him not to go away until he had conducted the army to its\n\ndestination, and handed it over to Thibron.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) I.e. \"at this moment the vote of banishment had not been passed\n\n    which would prevent his return to Athens.\" The natural inference\n\n    from these words is, I think, that the vote of banishment was\n\n    presently passed, at any rate considerably earlier than the battle\n\n    of Coronea in B.C. 394, five years and a half afterwards.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nVIII\n\n<br/><br/>\nFrom this place they sailed across to Lampsacus, and here Xenophon was  1\n\nmet by Eucleides the soothsayer, a Phliasian, the son of Cleagoras,\n\nwho painted \"the dreams (1)\" in the Lycium. Eucleides congratulated\n\nXenophon upon his safe return, and asked him how much gold he had got?\n\nand Xenophon had to confess: \"Upon my word, I shall have barely enough\n\nto get home, unless I sell my horse, and what I have about my person.\"\n", "The other could not credit the statement. Now when the Lampsacenes\n\nsent gifts of hospitality to Xenophon, and he was sacrificing to\n\nApollo, he requested the presence of Eucleides; and the latter, seeing\n\nthe victims, said: \"Now I believe what you said about having no money.\n\nBut I am certain,\" he continued, \"if it were ever to come, there is an\n\nobstacle in the way. If nothing else, you are that obstacle yourself.\"\n\nXenophon admitted the force of that remark. Then the other: \"Zeus\n\nMeilichios (2) is an obstacle to you, I am sure,\" adding in another\n\ntone of voice, \"have you tried sacrificing to that god, as I was wont\n\nto sacrifice and offer whole burnt offerings for you at home?\"\n\nXenophon replied that since he had been abroad, he had not sacrificed\n\nto that god. Accordingly Eucleides counselled him to sacrifice in the\n\nold customary way: he was sure that his fortune would improve. The\n\nnext day Xenophon went on to Ophrynium and sacrificed, offering a\n\nholocaust of swine, after the custom of his family, and the signs\n\nwhich he obtained were favourable. That very day Bion and Nausicleides\n\narrived laden with gifts for the army. These two were hospitably\n\nentertained by Xenophon, and were kind enough to repurchase the horse\n\nhe had sold in Lampsacus for fifty darics; suspecting that he had\n\nparted with it out of need, and hearing that he was fond of the beast\n\nthey restored it to him, refusing to be remunerated.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (1) Reading {ta enupnia}, or if {ta entoikhia} with Hug and others,\n\n    translate \"the wall-paintings\" or the \"frescoes.\" Others think\n\n    that a writing, not a painting, is referred to.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (2) Zeus Meilichios, or the gentle one. See Thuc. i. 126. The festival\n\n    of the Diasia at Athens was in honour of that god, or rather of\n\n    Zeus under that aspect. Cf. Arist. \"Clouds,\" 408.\n\n<br/><br/>", "From that place they marched through the Troad, and, crossing Mount\n\nIda, arrived at Antandrus, and then pushed along the seaboard of Mysia\n\nto the plain of Thebe (3). Thence they made their way through            8\n\nAdramytium and Certonus (4) by Atarneus, coming into the plain of the\n\nCaicus, and so reached Pergamus in Mysia.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (3) Thebe, a famous ancient town in Mysia, at the southern foot of Mt.\n\n    Placius, which is often mentioned in Homer (\"Il.\" i. 366, vi. 397,\n\n    xxii. 479, ii. 691). See \"Dict. Geog.\" s.v. The name {Thebes\n\n    pedion} preserves the site. Cf. above {Kaustrou pedion}, and such\n\n    modern names as \"the Campagna\" or \"Piano di Sorrento.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\n (4) The site of Certonus is not ascertained. Some critics have\n\n    conjectured that the name should be Cytonium, a place between\n\n    Mysia and Lydia; and Hug, who reads {Kutoniou}, omits {odeusantes\n\n    par 'Atanea}, \"they made their way by Atarneus,\" as a gloss.\n\n<br/><br/>\nHere Xenophon was hospitably entertained at the house of Hellas, the\n\nwife of Gongylus the Eretrian (5), the mother of Gorgion and Gongylus.\n\nFrom her he learnt that Asidates, a Persian notable, was in the plain.\n\n\"If you take thirty men and go by night, you will take him prisoner,\"\n\nshe said, \"wife, children, money, and all; of money he has a store;\"\n\nand to show them the way to these treasures, she sent her own cousin\n\nand Daphnagoras, whom she set great store by. So then Xenophon, with\n\nthese two to assist, did sacrifice; and Basias, an Eleian, the\n\nsoothsayer in attendance, said that the victims were as promising as\n\ncould be, and the great man would be an easy prey. Accordingly, after\n\ndinner he set off, taking with him the officers who had been his\n\nstaunchest friends and confidants throughout; as he wished to do them\n\na good turn. A number of others came thrusting themselves on their\n", "company, to the number of six hundred, but the officers repelled them:\n\n\"They had no notion of sharing their portion of the spoil,\" they said,\n\n\"just as though the property lay already at their feet.\"\n\n<br/><br/>\n (5) Cf. Thuc. i. 128; also \"Hell.\" III. i. 6.\n\n<br/><br/>\nAbout midnight they arrived. The slaves occupying the precincts of the\n\ntower, with the mass of goods and chattles, slipped through their\n\nfingers, their sole anxiety being to capture Asidates and his\n\nbelongings. So they brought their batteries to bear, but failing to\n\ntake the tower by assault (since it was high and solid, and well\n\nsupplied with ramparts, besides having a large body of warlike\n\ndefenders), they endeavoured to undermine it. The wall was eight clay\n\nbricks thick, but by daybreak the passage was effected and the wall\n\nundermined. At the first gleam of light through the aperture, one of    14\n\nthe defendants inside, with a large ox-spit, smote right through the\n\nthigh of the man nearest the hole, and the rest discharged their\n\narrows so hotly that it was dangerous to come anywhere near the\n\npassage; and what with their shouting and kindling of beacon fires, a\n\nrelief party at length arrived, consisting of Itabelius at the head of\n\nhis force, and a body of Assyrian heavy infantry from Comania, and\n\nsome Hyrcanian cavalry (6), the latter also being mercenaries of the\n\nking. There were eighty of them, and another detachment of light\n\ntroops, about eight hundred, and more from Parthenium, and more again\n\nfrom Apollonia and the neighbouring places, also cavalry.\n\n<br/><br/>\n (6) The Hyrcanian cavalry play an important part in the \"Cyropaedeia.\"\n\n    They are the Scirites of the Assyrian army who came over to Cyrus\n\n    after the first battle. Their country is the fertile land touching\n\n    the south-eastern corner of the Caspian. Cf. \"Cyrop.\" IV. ii. 8,\n", "    where the author (or an editor) appends a note on the present\n\n    status of the Hyrcanians.\n\n<br/><br/>\nIt was now high time to consider how they were to beat a retreat. So\n\nseizing all the cattle and sheep to be had, with the slaves, they put\n\nthem within a hollow square and proceed to drive them off. Not that\n\nthey had a thought to give to the spoils now, but for precaution's\n\nsake and for fear lest if they left the goods and chattels behind and\n\nmade off, the retreat would rapidly degenerate into a stampede, the\n\nenemy growing bolder as the troops lost heart. For the present then\n\nthey retired as if they meant to do battle for the spoils. As soon as\n\nGongylus espied how few the Hellenes were and how large the attacking\n\nparty, out he came himself, in spite of his mother, with his private\n\nforce, wishing to share in the action. Another too joined in the\n\nrescue--Procles, from Halisarna and Teuthrania, a descendant of\n\nDamaratus. By this time Xenophon and his men were being sore pressed\n\nby the arrows and slingstones, though they marched in a curve so as to\n\nkeep their shields facing the missiles, and even so, barely crossed the\n\nriver Carcasus, nearly half of them wounded. Here it was that Agasias\n\nthe Stymphalian, the captain, received his wound, while keeping up a\n\nsteady unflagging fight against the enemy from beginning to end. And\n\nso they reached home in safety with about two hundred captives, and\n\nsheep enough for sacrifices.\n\n<br/><br/>\nThe next day Xenophon sacrificed and led out the whole army under the   20\n\ncover of night, intending to pierce far into the heart of Lydia with a\n\nview to lulling to sleep the enemy's alarm at his proxmity, and so in\n\nfact to put him off his guard. But Asidates, hearing that Xenophon had\n\nagain sacrificed with the intention of another attack, and was\n\napproaching with his whole army, left his tower and took up quarters\n", "in some villages lying under the town of Parthenium. Here Xenophon's\n\nparty fell in with him, and took him prisoner, with his wife, his\n\nchildren, his horses, and all that he had; and so the promise of the\n\nearlier victims was literally fulfilled. After that they returned\n\nagain to Pergamus, and here Xenophon might well thank God with a warm\n\nheart, for the Laconians, the officers, the other generals, and the\n\nsoldiers as a body united to give him the pick of horses and cattle\n\nteams, and the rest; so that he was now in a position himself to do\n\nanother a good turn.\n\n<br/><br/>\nMeanwhile Thibron arrived and received the troops which he\n\nincorporated with the rest of his Hellenic forces, and so proceeded to\n\nprosecute a war against Tissaphernes and Pharnabazus (7).\n\n<br/><br/>\n (7) The MSS. add: \"The following is a list of the governors of the\n\n    several territories of the king which were traversed by us during\n\n    the expedition: Artimas, governor of Lydia; Artacamas, of Phrygia;\n\n    Mithridates, of Lycaonia and Cappadocia; Syennesis, of Cilicia;\n\n    Dernes, of Phoenicia and Arabia; Belesys, of Syria and Assyria;\n\n    Rhoparas, of Babylon; Arbacus, of Media; Tiribazus, of the\n\n    Phasians and Hesperites. Then some independent tribes--the\n\n    Carduchians or Kurds, and Chalybes, and Chaldaeans, and Macrones,\n\n    and Colchians, and Mossynoecians, and Coetians, and Tibarenians.\n\n    Then Corylas, the governor of Paphlagonia; Pharnabazus, of the\n\n    Bithynians; Seuthes, of the European Thracians. The entire\n\n    journey, ascent and descent, consisted of two hundred and fifteen\n\n    stages = one thousand one hundred and fifty-five parasangs =\n\n    thirty-four thousand six hundred and fifty stades. Computed in\n\n    time, the length of ascent and descent together amounted to one\n\n    year and three months.\" The annotator apparently computes the\n", "    distance from Ephesus to Cotyora.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ANABASIS ***\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\u2014the old editions will\n\nbe renamed.\n\n<br/><br/>\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\n\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\n\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\n\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\n\nroyalties.
